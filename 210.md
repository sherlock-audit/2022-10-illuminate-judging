# `autoRedeem()` could be abused to dilute other users fund

## Summary

The underlying amount users gets by `autoRedeem()` is based on the PT share percentage, this mechanism could be abused by malicious user with some vector like sandwich attack. 



## Vulnerability Detail

Imagine the following:
1. Alice has balance of 1,000 PT in the beginning, 10% of the 10,000 total supply of PT. `holdings[u1][m1]` is $1,000. In principle the amount Alice deserves is $100
2. a malicious user firstly buy 90,000 PT, inflate the  PT total supply to 100,000. Now alice only has 1% of the total supply
3. the malicious user calls `autoRedeem()` for Alice, the 1000 PT balance is burned, and the underlying redeemed is only $10 for Alice. 
4. the malicious user redeems the 90,000 PT for another  `(u2, m2)`, which is not affected by the total supply inflation.
5. At the end Alice loses some fund due to the diluted share.

Actually, the malicious user can also redeem in the same m`(u1, m1)`, because the majority of the `holdings[u1][m1]` cold be taken. 

The key point is the PT share percentage can be easily manipulated.


## Impact

User's PT balance share could be manipulated, some users will lose fund.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do the underlying redeem amount calculation based on the PT balance, instead of the external markets redeem amount and PT share percentage.
