# Compromised or malicious owner can easily rug 100% of user tokens held in `Lender.sol`

## Summary
The protocol has implemented a delay for `withdraw` but it can be very easily skipped by a compromised or malicious owner, resulting in a 100% rug for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Lender.sol` has a withdraw mechanism for an owner that includes a 3 day delay so admin can't rug users. This is good, but it can be bypassed very easily with the second `approve` method in the same contract - with it the owner can approve any address to spend any amount of any token any time. The same can happen for non-uderlying tokens with the first `approve` method in the contract.

## Impact
The impact can be 100% of users' tokens locked in `Lender.sol` being lost permanently, but it requires a malicious/compromised owner, hence Medium severity.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the same delay mechanism that is in `withdraw` to the `approve` methods.
