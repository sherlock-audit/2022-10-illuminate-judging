# `Reedemer.redeem()` for Sense will always fail

## Summary
Because of a missing approval to the `Converter` contract, the `Reedemer.redeem()` function for Sense will always fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a new market is created, the Marketplace contract calls the Reedemer contract's `approve()` function to give the Converter contract access to its tokens.

Reedemer uses Converter for 3 Principals:
* Sense
* Pendle
* APWine

But, in the `createMarket()` function of the Marketplace, the approval for Sense is missing. Thus, the Reedemer contract calls the Converter without granting it the approval to access Sense's compounding token. All of these calls will fail. Effectively, the tokens will be locked up.

There's actually a fork test for this specific scenario. But, the test uses Foundry's helper methods to manually approve the Converter contract to access the token.

## Impact
Users won't be able to redeem their Sense principal.

## Code Snippet
When a market is created, it only approves for Pendle and APwine: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L184-L196
```sol
  // Have the redeemer contract approve the Pendle principal token
  if (t[3] != address(0)) {
      address underlyingYieldToken = IPendleToken(t[3])
          .underlyingYieldToken();
      IRedeemer(redeemer).approve(underlyingYieldToken);
  }

  if (t[6] != address(0)) {
      address futureVault = IAPWineToken(t[6]).futureVault();
      address interestBearingToken = IAPWineFutureVault(futureVault)
          .getIBTAddress();
      IRedeemer(redeemer).approve(interestBearingToken);
  }
```

The `redeem()` function for Sense calls the Converter: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L379

```sol
  // Get the compounding token that is redeemed by Sense
  address compounding = ISenseAdapter(a).target();

  // Redeem the compounding token back to the underlying
  IConverter(converter).convert(
      compounding,
      u,
      IERC20(compounding).balanceOf(address(this))
  );
```

The fork test uses `startPrank()` to impersonate the Redeemer contract and approve the Converter for the test to pass: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/fork/Redeemer.t.sol#L370-L372

```sol
vm.startPrank(address(r));
IERC20(Contracts.WSTETH).approve(address(c), type(uint256).max);
vm.stopPrank();
```
If you comment out that snippet, the test will fail.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `createMarket()` approve the Sense token as well.
