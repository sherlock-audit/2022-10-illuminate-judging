# Yield/Illuminate lending only works when the user exposes themselves to slippage

## Summary

Yield/Illuminate lending only works when the user exposes themselves to slippage


## Vulnerability Detail

The `lend()` function for Yield/Illuminate requires that the amount received be greater than the minimum amount, rather than greater than or equal to, as is done for the other `lend()` functions.


## Impact

_Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds_

Users will be unable to use the Yield/Illuminate lending functionality, except if they expose themselves to at least one wei of slippage (though most won't know that one wei works, and will use more than is required).


## Code Snippet

The condition below requires that the user gets _more_ than they ask for, which means they must ask for less than they're likely to get, meaning accept some slippage:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.yield()   #1

948            // Get the ending balance of principal tokens (must be at least starting + returned)
949            uint256 received = IERC20(p).balanceOf(r) - starting;
950    
951            // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
952 @>         if (received <= m) {
953 @>             revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
954 @>         }
955    
956            return received;
957:       }
```

## Recommendation

Change the if-statement condition to be `received < m`
