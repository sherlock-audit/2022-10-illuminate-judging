# The address for swivel contract and pendle contract and tempus contract cannot be updated in the Redeemer.sol

## Summary

The address for swivel contract and pendle contract cannot be updated in the Redeemer.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

Once the swivel contract and pendle contract  is set in Redeemer.sol constructor, these two address cannot be updated.

```solidity
    /// @notice Initializes the Redeemer contract
    /// @param l the lender contract
    /// @param s the Swivel contract
    /// @param p the Pendle contract
    /// @param t the Tempus contract
    constructor(
        address l,
        address s,
        address p,
        address t
    ) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        lender = l;
        swivelAddr = s;
        pendleAddr = p;
        tempusAddr = t;
        feenominator = 4000;
    }
```

**However, given the context that the protocol is trying to integrate 9 external protocols, and each of the protocols already iterate over a few versions, not to mention that the illuminate protocol has been interactive in development, the swivelAddr and pendleAddr  can be deprecated and Redeem function for swivelAddr and pendleAddr will not be functional.**

## Impact

the swivelAddr and pendleAddr and tempusAddr can be deprecated and redeem function for swivelAddr and pendleAddr and tempus will not be functional in Redeemer.sol

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add methods to update the address for swivelAddr and pendleAddr and tempusAddr. The project may also consider using upgradeable pattern such as upgradeable proxy or diamond pattern.
