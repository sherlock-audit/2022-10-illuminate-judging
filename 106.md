# No markets can be created since Illuminate PTs are not ERC-4626 tokens

## Summary

No markets can be created since Illuminate PTs are not ERC-4626 tokens, and will cause pool creation to fail


## Vulnerability Detail

I checked with the sponsor and they confirmed that the plan was to use yieldspace-tv pools to swap Illuminate PTs for underlying, and that they planned to deploy the [existing pool contract](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-tv/blob/main/src/Pool/Pool.sol), rather than writing a new special [module](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-tv/tree/main/src/Pool/Modules). The existing `Pool` contract relies on the ERC-4626 interface to accomplish some of its tasks (and tokens that do not comply with it need to create new modules in order to override those functions). One such task is the fetching of the price, which relies on `IERC4626.convertToAssets()` which does not exist in the EIP-5095 [spec](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095) that the Illuminate PT follows. The fetching of the price is done in the pool constructor, and Illuminate PTs require the pool to already have been immutably set in the market before they're constructed, so therefore there is no way to create a market for any asset.

In addition to not being able to construct the pools, there are other functions such as `asset()`, and `deposit()` (note the flipped args), which do not exist in `ERC5095` but are relied on by the `Pool`, so even if the constructor issue is addressed, things will fail later.


## Impact

_Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds_

`MarketPlace.createMarket()` can't be called with a valid pool, so nobody can use any feature of the Illuminate project.


## Code Snippet

Market creation unconditionally constructs Illuminate PTs:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.createMarket()   #1

150            // Create an Illuminate principal token for the new market
151            address illuminateToken = address(
152 @>             new ERC5095(
153                    u,
154                    m,
155                    redeemer,
156                    lender,
157                    address(this),
158                    n,
159                    s,
160                    IERC20(u).decimals()
161                )
162:           );
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/MarketPlace.sol#L150-L162


Illuminate PTs are EIP-5095 contracts, not EIP-4626 ones, and do not implement the `convertToAssets()` function:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol   #2

13:@>  contract ERC5095 is ERC20Permit, IERC5095 {
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L13


The `immutable` pool is set in the constructor, and comes from the `MarketPlace`:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.constructor()   #3

37        constructor(
38            address _underlying,
39            uint256 _maturity,
40            address _redeemer,
41            address _lender,
42            address _marketplace,
43            string memory name_,
44            string memory symbol_,
45            uint8 decimals_
46        ) ERC20Permit(name_, symbol_, decimals_) {
47            underlying = _underlying;
48            maturity = _maturity;
49            redeemer = _redeemer;
50            lender = _lender;
51            marketplace = _marketplace;
52 @>         pool = IMarketPlace(marketplace).pools(underlying, maturity);
53:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L37-L53

Pools must be set ahead of time, and cannot change once set:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.setPool()   #4

259        function setPool(
260            address u,
261            uint256 m,
262            address a
263        ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
264            // Verify that the pool has not already been set
265            address pool = pools[u][m];
266    
267            // Revert if the pool already exists
268 @>         if (pool != address(0)) {
269 @>             revert Exception(10, 0, 0, pool, address(0));
270 @>         }
271    
272            // Set the pool
273            pools[u][m] = a;
274    
275            emit SetPool(u, m, a);
276            return true;
277:       }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/MarketPlace.sol#L259-L277

Yieldspace-tv `Pool`s rely on the function that does not exist in the Illuminate PT:
```solidity
    function _getCurrentSharePrice() internal view virtual returns (uint256) {
        uint256 scalar = 10**baseDecimals;
@>      return IERC4626(address(sharesToken)).convertToAssets(scalar);
    }


    /// Returns current price of 1 share in 64bit.
    /// Useful for external contracts that need to perform calculations related to pool.
    /// @return The current price (as determined by the token) scalled to 18 digits and converted to 64.64.
    function getC() external view returns (int128) {
@>      return _getC();
    }


    /// Returns the c based on the current price
    function _getC() internal view returns (int128) {
@>      return (_getCurrentSharePrice() * scaleFactor).divu(1e18);
    }
```
https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-tv/blob/8685abc2f57c2f3130165404a77620a3220fb182/src/Pool/Pool.sol#L1400-L1415

`getC()` is called by the constructor, so pools cannot be constructed with Illuminate PTs:
```solidity
@>        if ((mu = _getC()) == 0) {
```
https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-tv/blob/8685abc2f57c2f3130165404a77620a3220fb182/src/Pool/Pool.sol#L193

The existing fork tests mostly use the Yield USDC pool rather than creating an actual new pool.
