# ERC5095 hardcoded slippage tolerance is too low - it is 1% and can result in DoS for users

## Summary
The slippage tolerance in all ERC5095 methods is too low - 1% slippage tolerance. This can easily be exploited to result in DoS for protocol users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently all functionality - `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw`, `redeem` in `ERC5095` have hardcoded slippage tolerance that is very low - 1% (looks like `assets - (assets / 100)`). Now if someone wants to deny access to the protocol he can watch the mempool for transactions and always execute a swap in some direction so that the slippage tolerance is hit and the transaction for users revert. 
This is a griefing attack that will result in DoS for the protocol.
## Impact
The impact can be a prolonged DoS for all of the protocol's functionality via a griefing attack. This can result in value loss for users, for example when a token's price is falling quickly and they want to redeem/withdraw but they can't because of this slippage - their transactions will always revert. Since it can result in a loss of value but needs some special conditions I rate it Medium severity.

## Recommendation
Add a parameter for `minValueIn/maxValueOut` so the user can set it himself.
