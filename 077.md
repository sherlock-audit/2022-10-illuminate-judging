# Redeemer#autoRedeem may lead to users' share being redeemed at extremely bad exchange rates

## Summary

When PT shares are redeemed they are paid underlying pro rata to holdings. Holdings are increased when the lending protocols shares are redeemed to the underlying asset. autoRedeem is a public incentivized function that redeems a users' PT for underlying at the current exchange ratio. The problem is that if an underlying protocol hasn't been redeemed by the PT maturity time, autoRedeem may redeem them for a bad exchange ratio.

## Vulnerability Detail

            // Get the amount of tokens held by the owner
            uint256 amount = pt.balanceOf(f[i]);

            // Calculate how many tokens the user should receive
            uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / pt.totalSupply();

            // Calculate the fees to be received (currently .025%)
            uint256 fee = redeemed / feenominator;

autoRedeem distributes holdings pro rata to the total number of shares outstanding. If the redemption of an underlying protocol hasn't been called by the time the time the PT shares become mature then holding won't reflect the full amount of underlying. The result is that redeemed shares will exchange at a bad ratio. 

Redeemer#autoRedeem is an incentivized function and will likely be called by bots the moment PT shares become mature. By design, underlying protocols are all guaranteed to reach maturity before the PT shares, but there is no guarantee that they will be redeemed by the time the PT shares mature. Underlying protocols with a maturity that is close to the PT maturity would be highly susceptible to this issue.

## Impact

Users' share may redeemed at extremely bad exchange rates causing loss of funds

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

All functions that redeem user shares should first confirm that all underlying protocols have been redeemed first to make sure that the exchange rate is final before anyone redeems. I also understand not wanting to restrict user withdraws, so at the very least autoRedeem should be limited in this way.
