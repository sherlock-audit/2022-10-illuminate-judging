# Can not change fee used in Redeemer

## Summary
Redeemer can never set new fee amount, because `feeTime` is always zero.
## Vulnerability Detail
to change the fee in Redeemer represented by `feenominator`
we need to set `feeTime`, otherwise it is always zero
```solidity
src/Redeemer.sol
168:     function setFee(uint256 f) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
169:         uint256 feeTime = feeChange;
170:         if (feeTime == 0) {
171:             revert Exception(23, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
```

Implementation is same like in Lender, but it seems we forgot to add the method to update the `feechange` value, which required for fee change.

## Impact
Can not set new fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the missed method to update `feeChange` like in Lender
```solidity
src/Lender.sol
813:     function scheduleFeeChange() external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
814:         uint256 when = block.timestamp + HOLD;
815:         feeChange = when;
816: 
817:         emit ScheduleFeeChange(when);
818: 
819:         return true;
820:     }
```
