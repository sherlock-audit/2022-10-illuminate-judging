# Users' redemptions of Illuminate can be hijacked by front-running and minting more Illuminate

## Summary

`Redeemer.redeem(...)` (Illuminate variant) is vulnerable to frontrunning with `Lender.mint(...)`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Assume that an attacker noticed a pending transaction by an honest user to `redeem()` Illuminate tokens (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L403). The attacker can front-run this transaction and quickly mint more Illuminate tokens (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L270) for the given underlier and maturity, thus increasing the total supply of such tokens without increasing `Redeemer`'s `holdings`. The honest user will receive less than his fair share of the `Redeemer`'s holdings for that underlier and maturity. The attacker can then `redeem()` the external principal token for which he had minted Illuminate. He will then be able to `redeem()` his Illuminate tokens for an inflated amount of the underlying.

## Impact

Any attacker sophisticated enough to perform front-running can steal part of other users' redemptions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

* Disallow minting new Illuminate Tokens at or after maturity. Not only in `Lender.mint()` but also in all the variants of `Lender.lend(...)`
* Add another argument to `redeem()`: minimum acceptable amount of the underlying received by the caller.
