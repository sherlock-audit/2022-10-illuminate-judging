# User cannot redeem Illuminate tokens if amount to redeem is greater than holdings[u][m]

## Summary
When a user tries to redeem Illuminate tokens (using the Redeemer contract), the call will fail if the amount to redeem exceeds the holdings value for that `[underlying, maturity]` pair.

## Vulnerability Detail
Holdings mapping for a `[underlying, maturity]` pair is only increased in  certain function calls.
`redeem method for Swivel, Yield, Element, Pendle, APWine, Tempus and Notional protocols`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L329
`redeem method signature for Sense`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L394
But it is decreased in a number of other places, for instance in this function:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L403-L434
Which `burns Illuminate principal tokens and sends underlying to user`.
Acording to the [documentation](https://docs.illuminate.finance/smart-contracts/deposit-lifecycle#mint), 
>As an alternative to directly lending through Illuminate, users can also purchase external principal tokens and then wrap them at a 1:1 ratio into Illuminate Principal Tokens.
As an example, let's say a user lends 100 USDC directly on Notional in the December 2022 market at a rate of 5% for one year. This leaves the user with 105 Notional PTs.

>By then calling mint on Lender.sol, this user can then wrap their 105 Notional PTs into 105 Illuminate PTs (likely in order to perform arbitrage).
Lender: holds 105 Notional (External) PTs
User: holds 105 Illuminate PTs

So it could happen that a user minted Illuminate tokens, and after maturity try to redeem the underlying before any call has been made to the `redeem` functions above. This means that `holdings[u][m]` would be zero and the call to redeem by the user would fail.

## Impact
Inability from the user to redeem his/her tokens in certin scenarios.
