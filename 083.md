# yield() should be allow to equal the minimum amount

## Summary
yield() doesn't allow to equal the minimum amount to purchase, but It should be allowed

## Vulnerability Detail
The normal logic should be allowed to equal the minimum amountï¼Œ like "#elementSwap()" ,  "lend method signature for Notional" and "lend method signature for Sense" etc,  all allow equal  to  the minimum amount
## Impact
can't yield()  equal the minimum amount
## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L951-L954

```solidity
    function yield(
        address u,
        address y,
        uint256 a,
        address r,
        address p,
        uint256 m
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
...
       // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
        if (received <= m) { //*****@audit  can't not allow to equal the minimum amount ****/
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```

but other space , is allow,like:
```solidity
    function elementSwap(
        address e,
        Element.SingleSwap memory s,
        Element.FundManagement memory f,
        uint256 r,
        uint256 d
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
...
        // Verify that a minimum amount was received
        if (purchased < r) {  //*****@audit   allow to equal the minimum amount  ****/
            revert Exception(11, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }
```

```solidity
    function lend(
        uint8 p,
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        uint256 a,
        uint256 r
    ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (uint256) {
...

        // Verify that we received the principal tokens
        if (received < r) {    //*****@audit   allow to equal the minimum amount  ****/
            revert Exception(16, received, r, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
```solidity
    function yield(
        address u,
        address y,
        uint256 a,
        address r,
        address p,
        uint256 m
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
...
       // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
-       if (received <= m) {
+       if (received < m) { 
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
