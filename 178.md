# `redeem` does not work for Illuminate principal tokens

## Summary
The code does math that will always underflow and result in DoS

## Vulnerability Detail
In `redeem()` function in `Redeemer.sol` for Illuminate principal tokens we have the following piece of code:
`holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] - redeemed;`
The mistake here is that the code uses subtraction, when it should have used addition like in all other `redeem()` methods in the contract. This will result in an underflow error, essentially a DoS in this functionality

## Impact
The impact is permanent loss of funds for the users holding Illuminate principal tokens - they can't redeem them for underlying tokens. High severity should be appropriate.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] - redeemed;` to `holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] + redeemed;`
