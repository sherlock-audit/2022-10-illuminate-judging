# `maxWithdraw()` should use owner's balance

## Summary

In `maxWithdraw()`, the query for the PT balance for pre maturity is wrong, could potentially lead to fund leak of the whole token contract, and result in insolvency.


## Vulnerability Detail

For pre maturity, the `maxWithdraw()` was expected to return a previewWithdraw for owner's PT balance. But the actual returned value is PT balance of the whole PT token address, by using `_balanceOf[address(this)]`.


## Impact

Potentially, this could results in users withdraw more than balance fund, in other way, fund leak from the pool, and causing pool drained.

## Recommendation

Change `_balanceOf[address(this)]` to `_balanceOf[o]`.
