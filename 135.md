# Incorrect revert on mint

## Summary

Minimum purchase amount check in `yield` function is not correct.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `yield` function, the protocol checks the minimum amount condition (Lender.sol#L952) and it is reverting when the purchased amount is equal to the minimum amount specified. I believe the writer intended to use the strict inequality.

```solidity
function yield(
    address u,
    address y,
    uint256 a,
    address r,
    address p,
    uint256 m
) internal returns (uint256) {
    // Get the starting balance (to verify receipt of tokens)
    uint256 starting = IERC20(p).balanceOf(r);

    // Get the amount of tokens received for swapping underlying
    uint128 returned = IYield(y).sellBasePreview(Cast.u128(a));

    // Send the remaining amount to the Yield pool
    Safe.transfer(IERC20(u), y, a);

    // Lend out the remaining tokens in the Yield pool
    IYield(y).sellBase(r, returned);

    // Get the ending balance of principal tokens (must be at least starting + returned)
    uint256 received = IERC20(p).balanceOf(r) - starting;

    // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
    if (received <= m) { //@audit should be <
        revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
    }

    return received;
}
```

## Impact

Valid lending can be reverted.

## Recommendation

Revert only if the purchased amount is strictly below the minimum amount to purchase.
