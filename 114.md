# Illuminate's PT doesn't respect users' slippage specifications

## Summary

Illuminate's PT doesn't respect users' slippage specifications, and allows more slippage than is requested


## Vulnerability Detail

`ERC5095.withdraw()/redeem()`'s code adds extra slippage on top of what the user requests


## Impact

_Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield_
_Miner-extractable value (MEV)_

At the end of withdrawal/redemption, the user will end up losing more underlying than they wished to, due to slippage. If the user had used a external PT to mint the Illuminate PT, they will have lost part of their principal.


## Code Snippet

The NatSpec says `Before maturity, sends 'assets' by selling shares of PT on a YieldSpace AMM.`, so it's clear that the intention is to send back the amount of tokens specified in the input argument. In spite of this, extra slippage is allowed for the amount:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.withdraw()   #1

219                    uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(
220                        underlying,
221                        maturity,
222                        shares,
223 @>                     Cast.u128(a - (a / 100))
224                    );
225                    Safe.transfer(IERC20(underlying), r, returned);
226:                   return returned;
```

```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.withdraw()   #2

240                    uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(
241                        underlying,
242                        maturity,
243                        Cast.u128(shares),
244 @>                     Cast.u128(a - (a / 100))
245                    );
246                    Safe.transfer(IERC20(underlying), r, returned);
247:                   return returned;

(`redeem()` has the [same](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L294-L314) issue

and `IMarketPlace.sellPrincipalToken()` also considers the amount as an amount that already includes slippage:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.a   #3

279        /// @notice sells the PT for the underlying via the pool
280        /// @param u address of an underlying asset
281        /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market
282        /// @param a amount of PTs to sell
283 @>     /// @param s slippage cap, minimum amount of underlying that must be received
284        /// @return uint128 amount of underlying bought
285        function sellPrincipalToken(
286            address u,
287            uint256 m,
288            uint128 a,
289 @>         uint128 s
290:        ) external returns (uint128) {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Pass `Cast.u128(a)` to the two calls instead
