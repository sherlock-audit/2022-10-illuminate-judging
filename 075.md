# Lender#lend for Swivel will cause user to lose funds if they open a vault position

## Summary

Swivel#Initiate allows a user to open two different types of positions. The first is to open a ZcToken position (which is what is intended to be done) but the second allows the user to open a vault position. If the user opens vault position instead of a ZcToken, their funds will be lost forever

## Vulnerability Detail

    function initiate(Hash.Order[] calldata o, uint256[] calldata a, Sig.Components[] calldata c) external returns (bool) {
      uint256 len = o.length;
      // for each order filled, routes the order to the right interaction depending on its params
      for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
        Hash.Order memory order = o[i];
        if (!order.exit) {
          if (!order.vault) {

            //@audit allows initiate to open vault position instead of zc position

            initiateVaultFillingZcTokenInitiate(o[i], a[i], c[i]);
          } else {
            initiateZcTokenFillingVaultInitiate(o[i], a[i], c[i]);
          }
        } else {
          if (!order.vault) {
            initiateZcTokenFillingZcTokenExit(o[i], a[i], c[i]);
          } else {

            //@audit secondary way to open vault position instead of zc position

            initiateVaultFillingVaultExit(o[i], a[i], c[i]);
          }
        }
      }

The code above is taken from the deployed swivel contract. Initiate allows the user to open a vault position instead of a ZcToken. If a user were to open a vault position their funds would be permanently irretrievable since there is no way for lender to close out a vault position.

## Impact

User's funds are lost

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Validate for all of the orders, that order.vault == false.
