# Can't create multiple markets for ERC20 tokens that have approval protections

## Summary
It's not possible to create multiple markets for the same ERC20 token when the token has protection against the approval race condition.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens, e.g. [USDT](https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code), only allow you to set the approval to value $X > 0$ if it was $0$ previously.

In `Marketplace.createMarket()` you call `Lender.approve()` for a given token `u`. The first time you create a market for token `u`, there won't be any issues. But, the second time, Lender will already have set the approval amount to $X > 0$. The tx will fail.

## Impact
For a given token `u` that has protection against the approval race condition, you will only be able to create a single market.

## Code Snippet
`Lender.approve()` is called in `Marketplace.createMarket()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L182

It approves addresses `a`, `e`, and `n` to spend the Lender's `u` tokens: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L194-L214

*Btw, there's a mismatch in the parameter order in the call to `Lender.approve()`. The function signature is `approve(u, a, e, n)` but you call it with `approve(u, e, a, n)`. The addresses of `e` and `a` are swapped. But, because the same logic is executed for both params, it's not a real issue.*

Approval race condition protection implemented in the USDT contract: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`approve()` should only be called if the current approval is set to `0`.
