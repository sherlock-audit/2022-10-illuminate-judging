# Allowance update should use the share, not the amount

## Summary

In `withdraw()`, the post maturity allowance update deducts the amount
of underlying from the old allowance, but PT shares should be used.

## Vulnerability Detail

The units for PT is the shares, rather than the underlying token amount. Mix with the two could introduce ambiguity and potential wrong allowance.


## Impact

Potentially, this could results in inaccurate amount of allowance being recorded, and in the future lead to users' fund loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `shares` instead of `a` in line 266.
