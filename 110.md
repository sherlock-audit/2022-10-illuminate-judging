# Notional PT redemptions do not use flash-resistant prices

## Summary

Notional PT redemptions do not use the correct function for determining balances, which will lead to principal losses


## Vulnerability Detail

EIP-4626 states the following about `maxRedeem()`:
```markdown
MUST return the maximum amount of shares that could be transferred from `owner` through `redeem` and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary).

MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if redemption is entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.
```
https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/12fb4072a8204ae89c384a5562dedfdac32a3bec/EIPS/eip-4626.md?plain=1#L414-L416


The above means that the implementer is free to return less than the actual balance, and is in fact _required_ to return zero if the token's backing store is paused, and Notional's [can be paused](https://docs.notional.finance/developer-documentation/on-chain/notional-governance-reference#pauseability). While neither of these conditions currently apply to the existing [wfCashERC4626 implementation](https://github.com/notional-finance/wrapped-fcash/blob/ad5c145d9988eeee6e36cf93cc3412449e4e7eba/contracts/wfCashERC4626.sol#L89-L92), there is nothing stopping Notional from implementing the MUST-return-zero-if-paused fix tomorrow, or from changing their implementation to one that requires `maxRedeem()` to return something other than the current balance. 


## Impact

_Permanent freezing of funds_

If `maxRedeem()` were to return zero, or some other non-exact value, fewer Notional PTs would be redeemed than are available, and users that `redeem()`ed their shares, would receive fewer underlying (principal if they minted Illuminate PTs with Notional PTs, e.g. to be an LP in the pool) than they are owed. The Notional PTs that weren't redeemed would still be available for a subsequent call, but if a user already redeemed their Illuminate PTs, their loss will already be locked in, since their Illuminate PTs will have been burned. This would affect _ALL_ Illuminate PT holders of a specific market, not just the ones that provided the Notional PTs, because Illuminate PT redemptions are an a share-of-underlying basis, not on the basis of the originally-provided token. Markets that are already live with Notional set cannot be protected via a redemption pause by the Illuminate admin, because redemption of `Lender`'s external PTs for underlying does not use the `unpaused` modifier, and does have any access control.


## Code Snippet

```solidity
// File: src/Redeemer.sol : Redeemer.redeem()   #1

309                // Retrieve the pool for the principal token
310                address pool = ITempusToken(principal).pool();
311    
312                // Redeems principal tokens from Tempus
313                ITempus(tempusAddr).redeemToBacking(pool, amount, 0, address(this));
314            } else if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Apwine)) {
315                apwineWithdraw(principal, u, amount);
316            } else if (p == uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Notional)) {
317                // Redeems principal tokens from Notional
318                INotional(principal).redeem(
319 @>                 INotional(principal).maxRedeem(address(this)),
320                    address(this),
321                    address(this)
322                );
323            }
324    
325            // Calculate how much underlying was redeemed
326            uint256 redeemed = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) - starting;
327    
328            // Update the holding for this market
329:           holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] + redeemed;

Redemptions of Illuminate PTs for underlyings is based on shares of each Illuminate PT's `totalSupply()` of the _available_ underlying, not the expect underlying total:

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Use `balanceOf()` rather than `maxRedeem()` in the call to `INotional.redeem()`, and make sure that Illuminate PTs can't be burned if `Lender` still has Notional PTs that it needs to redeem (based on its own accounting of what is remaining, not based on balance checks, so that it can't be griefed with dust).
