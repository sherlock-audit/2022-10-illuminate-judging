# Wrong slippage control in `ERC5095.mint` will make user get less tokens than deserved

## Summary
When a user is buying iPTs using `ERC5095.mint` , `mint` tells `Marketplace` that the minimum amount out should be `assets - (assets / 100)` instead of `shares - (shares/ 100)`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Since iPTs trade at a discount, the assets supplied will always be less than the shares bought.
By setting the slippage to use assets instead of shares, the user is "guaranteed" (by MEV bots) to get iPT *equal* to the amount of underlying assets he supplied. (Even a little less with the 1% slippage.)
But **this negates the whole point of buying PTs**, as he didn't get any market discount on them. He simply exchanged his underlying to PTs which are worth less in the market. He can either have them locked until maturity not earning any yield, or sell them at a loss.

## Impact
Freezing or loss of user assets, and negating the whole point of interacting with Illuminate, as detailed above.

## Code Snippet
`Marketplace.sellUnderlying` [takes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L361) the minimum amount of iPTs to be received as the 4th parameter:
```solidity
    /// @param s slippage cap, minimum number of PTs that must be received
    function sellUnderlying(address u, uint256 m, uint128 a, uint128 s) external returns (uint128) {
```

But `ERC5095` [sends](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L198) to `Marketplace` the asset amount in the slippage control, instead of the shares amount (`s`).
```solidity
        uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
            underlying,
            maturity,
            assets,
            assets - (assets / 100)
        );
```
Therefore the abovementioned discrepancy happens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
The 4th parameter to `sellUnderlying` should be changed to `s - (s / 100)`.
