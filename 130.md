# `ERC5095.mint()` uses the wrong slippage limit.

## Summary
`ERC5095.mint()` uses the wrong slippage limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
`ERC5095.mint()` sells the underlying through the pool and mints the principal tokens to the users before maturity.

It calls `MarketPlace.sellUnderlying()` for that purpose as below.

```solidity
    // consider the hardcoded slippage limit, 4626 compliance requires no minimum param.
    uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
        underlying,
        maturity,
        assets,
        assets - (assets / 100) //@audit use s instead of assets
    );
```

And [MarketPlace.sellUnderlying()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L361-L386) has a `s` parameter to check slippage limit after the swap.

```solidity
    function sellUnderlying(
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        uint128 a,
        uint128 s
    ) external returns (uint128) {
        // Get the pool for the market
        IPool pool = IPool(pools[u][m]);

        // Get the number of PTs received for selling `a` underlying tokens
        uint128 expected = pool.sellBasePreview(a);

        // Verify slippage does not exceed the one set by the user
        if (expected < s) {
            revert Exception(16, expected, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Transfer the underlying tokens to the pool
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(pool.base()), msg.sender, address(pool), a);

        // Execute the swap
        uint128 received = pool.sellBase(msg.sender, expected);

        emit Swap(u, m, u, address(pool.fyToken()), received, a, msg.sender);
        return received;
    }
```

This slippage is for the principal shares after the swap but `mint()` inputs `assets - (assets / 100)` instead of `s - (s / 100)`.

## Impact
`ERC5095.mint()` uses the wrong value for the slippage so that the function might work unexpectedly.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We should change [this part](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L194-L199) like below.

```solidity
    uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
        underlying,
        maturity,
        assets,
        s - (s / 100)
    );
```
