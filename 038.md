# Possible to create market for a protocol while Illuminate market is not created

## Summary
Possible to create market for a protocol while Illuminate market is not created
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `Marketplace.createMarket` checks if illuminate market [exists](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L145-L147) and if no, then it creates [new Illuminate market](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L151-L162) and set all other protocol's principal markets. The main thing is that markets for token and maturity should not exists if Illuminate market was nor created.

Also `Marketplace` has function `setPrincipal` which allows to set any other protocol(allowed by illuminate) principal market. After check that market isn't set already it just [set it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L224).

So thing function makes it possible to create another protocols market without having illuminate one.

Example.
Admin set market for `Yield` protocol using `setPrincipal` function. Illuminate market do not exist for this base token and maturity.
As a result `Yield` market is available for using, while no illuminate market.
## Impact
You can work with another market while illuminate is not created.

## Recommendation
Check that illuminate market already exist.
