# The address for swivel contract and pendle contract cannot be updated in the Lender.sol

## Summary

The address for swivel contract and pendle contract cannot be updated in the Lender.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

Once the swivel contract and pendle contract  is set in Lender.sol constructor, these two address cannot be updated.

```solidity
    /// @notice initializes the Lender contract
    /// @param s the Swivel contract
    /// @param p the Pendle contract
    constructor(address s, address p) {
        admin = msg.sender;
        swivelAddr = s;
        pendleAddr = p;
        feenominator = 1000;
    }
```

**However, given the context that the protocol is trying to integrate 9 external protocols, and each of the protocols already iterate over a few versions, not to mention that the illuminate protocol has been interactive in development, the swivelAddr and pendleAddr  can be deprecated and Lending function for swivelAddr and pendleAddr will not be functional.**

For example, the pendleAddr is a Uniswap Router V2 like contract.

```solidity
// Swap on the Pendle Router using the provided market and params
returned = IPendle(pendleAddr).swapExactTokensForTokens(
    a - fee,
    r,
    path,
    address(this),
    d
)[1];
```

if one day, the pendle finance decides to remove liquidity and not supporting this router anymore and offer a solution to trade principle token for pendle elsewhere, the pendle address is deprecated and the lending feature for pendle will not be functional


## Impact

the swivelAddr and pendleAddr  can be deprecated and Lending function for swivelAddr and pendleAddr will not be functional.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project add methods to update the address for swivelAddr and pendleAddr. The project may also consider using upgradeable pattern such as upgradeable proxy or diamond pattern.
