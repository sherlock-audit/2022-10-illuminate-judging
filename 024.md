# Protocol will lose fees when lending on Swivel and swapping in YieldPool

## Summary
When a user uses `Lender.lend` to lend on Swivel, and passes `e=true` so remainder of funds will be swapped in YieldPool,
The contract will send to the YieldPool the order's protocol fee as well.

## Vulnerability Detail
Detailed above and in the code snippet below.

## Impact
Protocol funds will be lost, as user will not pay fee for this order.
Fees accounting will be wrong, as `fees` contains fees which are not present in the contract. `withdrawFee` will fail (as it tries to withdraw more than balance) and admin will have to withdraw fees using the emergency mechanism.

## Code Snippet
When landing on Swivel, `Lender` will sum up the fees of the order, substract it from the order amount, and then [add](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L400) it to `fees`:
```solidity
                // Add the accumulated fees to the total
                a[lastIndex] = a[lastIndex] - fee; // Revert here if fee not paid
                // Extract fee
                fees[u] += fee;
```
After initiating the Swivel order, the function checks what's the underlying remainder, and [sends](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L417) it to Yield to swap to iPTs:
```solidity
                if (e) {
                    // Calculate the premium
                    uint256 premium = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) - starting;
                    // Swap the premium for Illuminate principal tokens
                    swivelLendPremium(u, m, y, premium, premiumSlippage);
                }
```
Note that since the fees have not been sent to Swivel, they are included in the `premium` delta.
They are then sent to be swapped on Yield using `swivelLendPremium`.
Therefore, the fees will be lost, the accounting will be off, and `withdrawFee` [will revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L862) when it tries to send more than the contract's balance.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deduct `fee` from `premium`.
