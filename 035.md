# Redeemer.autoRedeem relies on base token allowance. This can be maliciously used.

## Summary
Redeemer.autoRedeem relies on base token allowance. This can be maliciously used.
## Vulnerability Detail
As i disscussed with sponsor, `Redeemer.autoRedeem` function can be triggered by any actor. This function will redeem iPT of users provided in the list and the msg.sender will get some fee(this fee is paid by user provided in the list, not protocol). To agree with such redeem user should provide allowance on base token to `Redeemer` address for the amount more then iPT balance of user.

So if you have some iPT and you don't mind if someone will redeem then instead of you, then you should provide allowance to Redeemer with amount > then your iPT balance.

This is the main part of function that we need to look into
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L511-L525
```solidity
            uint256 allowance = uToken.allowance(f[i], address(this));

            // Get the amount of tokens held by the owner
            uint256 amount = pt.balanceOf(f[i]);

            // Calculate how many tokens the user should receive
            uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / pt.totalSupply();

            // Calculate the fees to be received (currently .025%)
            uint256 fee = redeemed / feenominator;

            // Verify allowance
            if (allowance < amount) {
                revert Exception(20, allowance, amount, address(0), address(0));
            }
```

Let's consider next situation.

User have `100 iPT with maturity 1.01.2023` and also user has `100 iPT with maturity 1.02.2023`. Both them use same base token.
On time > 1.02.2023 all tokens can be redeemed and user wants to allow to redeem with fee only `100 iPT with maturity 1.01.2023`. So he provides allowance in base token for Redeemer with amount 100.
He expects that only `100 iPT with maturity 1.01.2023` will be redeemed with fee. 
But the problem is that `autoRedeem` function do not care about maturity of iPT, it handles all iPT with different maturity same. You just need to have allowance in base token.

Now another actor can redeem both `100 iPT with maturity 1.01.2023` and `100 iPT with maturity 1.02.2023` tokens and get fee.

As you can see this mechanism do not protect user from redeeming all his tokens with fee.
Also another thing is that after the redeeming if user bought new iPS tokens with another maturity and amount <= allowance, then another actor again can redeem them after maturity as allowance is still there.
## Impact
User lose on redemption fees. Users funds are converted without his contest.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Looks like you can't handle different maturity iPS in such way as they use same base token. Also allowance is always present till it will be deleted by user, but it's not convinient, he can forget.
