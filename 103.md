# No checks that immutable pools match the market

## Summary
There are no checks that the immutably set pool for a market actually matches the market's tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
A pool for a market can only be set once, and there are no checks to ensure that the pool's underlying matches the market's underlying.

## Impact

_Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds_

If the underlying doesn't match, users will not be able to use the pool and thus won't be able to redeem prior to the market's maturity.

## Code Snippet
Once set, the pool cannot be changed:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.setPool()   #1

263        ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
264            // Verify that the pool has not already been set
265            address pool = pools[u][m];
266    
267            // Revert if the pool already exists
268            if (pool != address(0)) {
269                revert Exception(10, 0, 0, pool, address(0));
270            }
271    
272            // Set the pool
273 @>         pools[u][m] = a;
274    
275            emit SetPool(u, m, a);
276            return true;
277:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`require()` that the Illuminate PT is the pool's token
