# function autoRedeem should check the principle token allowance instead of the underlying token allowance in Redeemer.sol

## Summary

function autoRedeem should check the principle token allowance instead of the underlying token in Redeemer.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

The autoRedeem function in Redeemer is implemented below.

```solidity
// Retrieve the underlying
IERC20 uToken = IERC20(u);

// Sum up the fees received by the caller
uint256 incentiveFee;

// Get the number of owners to loop through
uint256 length = f.length;

// Loop through the provided arrays and mature each individual position
for (uint256 i; i != length; ) {
	// Fetch the allowance set by the holder of the principal tokens
	uint256 allowance = uToken.allowance(f[i], address(this));

	// Get the amount of tokens held by the owner
	uint256 amount = pt.balanceOf(f[i]);

	// Calculate how many tokens the user should receive
	uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / pt.totalSupply();

	// Calculate the fees to be received (currently .025%)
	uint256 fee = redeemed / feenominator;

	// Verify allowance
	if (allowance < amount) {
		revert Exception(20, allowance, amount, address(0), address(0));
	}

	// Burn the tokens from the user
	pt.authBurn(f[i], amount);
```

Our focus is on three lines of code:

first:

```solidity
// Retrieve the underlying
IERC20 uToken = IERC20(u);
```

second:

```solidity
// Fetch the allowance set by the holder of the principal tokens
uint256 allowance = uToken.allowance(f[i], address(this));
```

Third:

```solidity
// Burn the tokens from the user
pt.authBurn(f[i], amount);
```

We want to burn the principle token from user but we are checking the allowance for underlying token.

## Impact

We want to burn the principle token from user but we are checking the allowance for underlying token. Clearly the pt.burn may revert in insufficient allowance error.

## Recommendation

Chaneg from 

```solidity
// Fetch the allowance set by the holder of the principal tokens
uint256 allowance = uToken.allowance(f[i], address(this));
```

to

```solidity
// Fetch the allowance set by the holder of the principal tokens
uint256 allowance = pt.allowance(f[i], address(this));
```
