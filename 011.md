# Lender.mint() May Take The Illuminate PT As Input Which Will Transfer And Mint More Illuminate PT Cause an Infinite Supply

## Summary
Steps:

Lender.lend() with p = 0 to get some Illuminate principal tokens
token.approve() gives Lender allowance to spend these tokens
loop:
Lender.mint() with p = 0 minting more principal tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Lender.mint() may use p = 0 which will mean principal is the same as principalToken(u, m) i.e. the Illuminate PT. The impact is we will transfer some principal to the Lender contract and it will mint us an equivalent amount of principal tokens.

This can be repeated indefinitely thereby minting infinite tokens. The extra balance will be store in Lender.
