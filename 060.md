# Users can provide Illuminate principal tokens to mint Illuminate principal tokens, which will reduce the number of underlying tokens redeemed by all users

## Summary
Users can provide Illuminate principal tokens to mint Illuminate principal tokens, which will reduce the number of underlying tokens redeemed by all users
## Vulnerability Detail
In the mint function of the Lender contract, users can provide Illuminate principal tokens to mint Illuminate principal tokens, which will increase the total supply of Illuminate principal tokens.
Later, when all users redeem Illuminate principal tokens in the Redeemer contract, the number of underlying tokens received by the user decreases due to the increase in total supply
## Impact
the number of underlying tokens received by the user decreases due to the increase in total supply
