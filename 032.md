# Changing the converter in the Redeemer contract will break the redeem functionality for 3 principals

## Summary
When `Redeemer.setConverter()` is called to change the converter address, the redeem functionality for the Pendle, APWine, and Sense principal tokens will be broken.



## Vulnerability Detail
The Redeemer contract has a function `setConverter()` which allows the admin to update the `converter` address. The Converter is used to swap tokens when redeeming the Pendle, APwine, and Sense principal tokens. But, for the Converter to be usable, the Redeemer contract has to approve it to access the respective tokens. Only the Marketplace can trigger the approval logic and it does it when a new market is created. So when the Converter contract is changed, the new one won't have the Redeemer contract's token approvals. Any calls to the Converter when redeeming Pendle, APWine, or Sense principal tokens will fail.

## Impact
The user won't be able to redeem Pendle, APWine, and Sense principal tokens.

## Code Snippet
`setConverter()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L148-L152

Converter is used when redeeming the three principal tokens named above:

- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L379
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L580

Converter needs token approval because of the call to `transferFrom`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Converter.sol#L27

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `setConverter()`, set the approvals for the new Converter address.
