# DoS `autoRedeem()` to lock other users fund

## Summary

The purpose of the `autoRedeem()` function is to make it easier for some users to redeem the underlying when they are not available. But this feature could be abused to DoS the function and lock users' fund.


## Vulnerability Detail

If the allowance and amount are close, the griefer can send just enough of PT to the victim's address to just make the `if (allowance < amount)` check fail.

```solidity
        uint256 amount = pt.balanceOf(f[i]);
        // ...
        if (allowance < amount) {
            revert Exception(20, allowance, amount, address(0), address(0));
        }
```


## Impact

- Some users' fund could be locked and fail the `autoRedeem()` function.
- The `autoRedeem()` function could be easily DoS and fail.
