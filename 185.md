# `mint` does not mint

## Summary
`mint` does not mint anything when called on `block.timestamp == maturity`
## Vulnerability Detail
`mint()` call on `block.timestamp == maturity`
will lead to `assets = 0` 

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
186:         uint128 assets = Cast.u128(previewMint(s));
```

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
118:     function previewMint(uint256 s) public view returns (uint256) {
119:         if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
120:             return IYield(pool).buyFYTokenPreview(Cast.u128(s));
121:         }
122:         return 0;
123:     }
```

which will lead to zero transfer and zero swap

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
187:         Safe.transferFrom(
188:             IERC20(underlying),
189:             msg.sender,
190:             address(this),
191:             assets
192:         );
193:         // consider the hardcoded slippage limit, 4626 compliance requires no minimum param.
194:         uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
195:             underlying,
196:             maturity,
197:             assets,
198:             assets - (assets / 100)
199:         );
200:         _transfer(address(this), r, returned);
```

## Impact
User will waste gas and/or his smart will revert because no value was returned

## Recommendation
Revert on maturity as you intended looking at your comments
```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
172:     /// @notice Before maturity spends `assets` of underlying, and sends `shares` of PTs to `receiver`. Post or at maturity, reverts.
```

```diff
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
176:     function mint(address r, uint256 s) external override returns (uint256) {
- 177:         if (block.timestamp > maturity) {
+ 177:         if (block.timestamp >= maturity) {
```
