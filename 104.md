# ERC777 transfer hooks can be used to bypass fees for markets that support Swivel

## Summary

ERC777 transfer hooks can be used to bypass fees for markets that support Swivel


## Vulnerability Detail

Most of the `lend()` functions calculate fees based on an amount that is directly transferred by the `Lender` contract. In the case of the Swivel version of `lend()`, it assumes that the Swivel orders provided are operating on the underlying, and only calculates fees based on those. After that, it allows the user to swap any excess underlying with `swivelLendPremium()`, and there are no checks that the 'premium' amount is a dust amount, and there are no fees charged on this amount.

If a user submits a Swivel order that _adds_ one wei of Notional tokens (one of Swivel's supported tokens) to a Swivel position, which are ERC777 tokens, the user can use the pre-transfer hook to send a large amount of underlying to the `Lender` contract, so that when `swivelLendPremium()` is called, the large balance is swapped without fees. The one wei of Notional contributes zero to the fee, since the `feenominator` calculation is vulnerable to loss of precision.

A malicious user can automate this process by deploying a contract that does this automatically for novice users.


## Impact

_No protocol fees_

Users can pay zero fees


## Code Snippet

Fees are based on the order amounts:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #1

383                // Lent represents the total amount of underlying to be lent
384 @>             uint256 lent = swivelAmount(a);
385    
386                // Transfer underlying token from user to Illuminate
387                Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), msg.sender, address(this), lent);
388    
389                // Get the underlying balance prior to calling initiate
390                uint256 starting = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this));
391    
392                // Verify and collect the fee
393                {
394                    // Calculate fee for the total amount to be lent
395:@>                 uint256 fee = lent / feenominator;
```

No fees are charged on the premium:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #2

407                uint256 received;
408                {
409                    // Get the starting amount of principal tokens
410                    uint256 startingZcTokens = IERC20(
411                        IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p)
412                    ).balanceOf(address(this));
413    
414                    // Fill the given orders on Swivel
415                    ISwivel(swivelAddr).initiate(o, a, s);
416    
417 @>                 if (e) {
418 @>                     // Calculate the premium
419 @>                     uint256 premium = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) -
420 @>                         starting;
421 @> 
422 @>                     // Swap the premium for Illuminate principal tokens
423 @>                     swivelLendPremium(u, m, y, premium, premiumSlippage);
424 @>                 }
425    
426                    // Compute how many principal tokens were received
427                    received =
428                        IERC20(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p)).balanceOf(
429                            address(this)
430                        ) -
431                        startingZcTokens;
432                }
433    
434:               // Mint Illuminate principal tokens to the user

[Notional](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/fork/Contracts.sol#L19-L20) tokens are proxies of [`ERC777`](https://etherscan.io/address/0x895f0630d604fd7140d84ef9920c71171ae40fbf#code#F9#L68) tokens

## Recommendation

Charge a fee based on the total underlying after the Swivel orders are executed
