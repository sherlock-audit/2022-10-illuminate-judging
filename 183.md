# Loss of tokens on deposit

## Summary
`deposit()` will return zero shares when called on `block.timestamp == maturity`
## Vulnerability Detail
`deposit()` call on `block.timestamp == maturity`
will lead to `shares = 0` 

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
159:         uint128 shares = Cast.u128(previewDeposit(a));//@audit 0 at maturity
```

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
108:     function previewDeposit(uint256 a) public view returns (uint256) {
109:         if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
110:             return IYield(pool).sellBasePreview(Cast.u128(a));
111:         }
112:         return 0;
113:     }
```

which will lead to slippage being zero on swap call

```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
162:         uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellUnderlying(
163:             underlying,
164:             maturity,
165:             Cast.u128(a),
166:             shares - (shares / 100)//@audit if shares are 0, then all underlying goes to mev bots
167:         );
```

## Impact
User will lose all their tokens to mev bots
The fact that `block.timestamp` can be manipulated by miner/validator only makes such outcome more likely, when malicious parties are collaborating.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Revert on maturity as you intended looking at your comments
```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
145:     /// @notice Before maturity spends `assets` of underlying, and sends `shares` of PTs to `receiver`. Post or at maturity, reverts.
```

```diff
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
149:     function deposit(address r, uint256 a) external override returns (uint256) {
- 150:         if (block.timestamp > maturity) {
+ 150:         if (block.timestamp >= maturity) {
```
