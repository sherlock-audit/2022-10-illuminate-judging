# `IAPWineRouter` can be used to lock all protocol fees

## Summary

`IAPWineRouter` can be used to lock all protocol fees


## Vulnerability Detail

The `lend()` function for APWine lending uses a user-supplied address for the APWine pool, but never checks that the pool uses the same underlying as the `lend()` function takes from the caller. If the attacker uses a pool where the underlying doesn't match what was provided, the attacker can have the APWine router convert the underlying that already exists in the contract as protocol fees. 


## Impact

_Griefing_

An attacker can lock all protocol fees in a specific underlying by providing a small amount of the correct underlying, but providing the pool for a different underlying. Because the withdrawal of fees is all or none, and is based on a contract-stored sum, if the balance is at least one wei less than the contract-stored sum, the admin will be unable to withdraw fees. If the attacker is willing to spend an amount equal to the stored fees, the admin must manually deposit enough fees to make up the difference before they can withdraw again. If the attacker is well-funded, they may lock more fees than the admin can afford to send.


## Code Snippet

The marketplace approves the APWine router whenever a market is created:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.approve()   #1

194        function approve(
195            address u,
196            address a,
197            address e,
198            address n
199        ) external authorized(marketPlace) {
200            uint256 max = type(uint256).max;
201            IERC20 uToken = IERC20(u);
202            if (a != address(0)) {
203 @>             Safe.approve(uToken, a, max);
204:           }
```

There are no checks that the provided pool is using the right underlying:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.lend()   #2

572        function lend(
573            uint8 p,
574            address u,
575            uint256 m,
576            uint256 a,
577            uint256 r,
578            uint256 d,
579            address x,
580            address pool
581        ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (uint256) {
582            address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p);
583    
584            // Transfer funds from user to Illuminate
585            Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(u), msg.sender, address(this), a);
586    
587            uint256 lent;
588            {
589                // Add the accumulated fees to the total
590                uint256 fee = a / feenominator;
591                fees[u] = fees[u] + fee;
592    
593                // Calculate amount to be lent out
594                lent = a - fee;
595            }
596    
597            // Get the starting APWine token balance
598            uint256 starting = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(address(this));
599    
600            // Swap on the APWine Pool using the provided market and params
601 @>         IAPWineRouter(x).swapExactAmountIn(
602                pool,
603                apwinePairPath(),
604                apwineTokenPath(),
605                lent,
606                r,
607                address(this),
608                d,
609                address(0)
610            );
611    
612            // Calculate the amount of APWine principal tokens received after the swap
613            uint256 received = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(address(this)) -
614                starting;
615    
616            // Mint Illuminate zero coupons
617            IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, received);
618    
619            emit Lend(p, u, m, received, a, msg.sender);
620            return received;
621:       }
```

If the `received` amount above is zero, minting still is able to go through:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC20.sol : ERC20:_mint()   #3

213    function _mint(address dst, uint256 wad) internal virtual returns (bool) {
214        _balanceOf[dst] = _balanceOf[dst] + wad;
215        _totalSupply = _totalSupply + wad;
216        emit Transfer(address(0), dst, wad);
217
218        return true;
219:   }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC20.sol#L213-L219


The admin won't be able to withdraw, since the calculated fees are larger than the actual balance:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.withdrawFee()   #4

857        function withdrawFee(address e) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
858            // Get the token to be withdrawn
859            IERC20 token = IERC20(e);
860    
861            // Get the balance to be transferred
862 @>         uint256 balance = fees[e];
863    
864            // Reset accumulated fees of the token to 0
865            fees[e] = 0;
866    
867            // Transfer the accumulated fees to the admin
868 @>         Safe.transfer(token, admin, balance);
869    
870            return true;
871:       }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Verify that the pool's underlying matches the lent underlying, and an `amount` argument to `withdrawFee()`, which, if non-zero, will withdraw less than the total calculated balance
