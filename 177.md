# Griefing attack vector in `Lender.sol` `mint()` can result in big value loss for users

## Summary
The `mint()` function allows anyone to endlessly mint Illuminate principal tokens, while his balance stays the same, just paying for gas.

## Vulnerability Detail
With the current implementation of `mint()` in `Lender.sol` you can pass the value of 0 as the `p` argument, meaning you will be minting Illuminate principal tokens. Now, if you input 100 Illuminate principal tokens the function will take them from you and store them in Lender.sol's balance, but it will give you back new 100 Illuminate principal tokens. This can be done almost infinitely, increasing the total supply of Illuminate's principal token almost infinitely. 
Now the actual grief comes from the fact that when maturity time passes, when the users want to redeem their underlying tokens of their Illuminate principal token holdings, the following math is used `uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / token.totalSupply();`. If `token.totalSupply()` is a very big value, bigger than `(amount * holdings[u][m])` then users will always either redeem 0 (meaning they lose all of their tokens) or if the ERC20 token reverts on 0 value transfers then their `redeem()` will always revert also (DoS).

## Impact
The impact of this can be 100% value loss for users due to 0 value redeem or permanent DoS. Since this attack can be executed by anyone in a griefing manner - the malicious actor just has to pay for gas - I rate this as a High severity issue.

## Recommendation
Add the following check on the first line of Lender::mint
`require(p != uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Illuminate));`
