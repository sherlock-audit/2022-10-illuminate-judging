# Users might redeem their iPTs before Lender's PTs have been redeemed

## Summary
If users redeem their iPTs before the individual protocols markets have been redeemed for underlying,
the users will lose their funds.
While you are probably aware of the issue, I think it is worth bringing up, as it is fixable and can lead to loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
`Redeemer` allows users to redeem their iPTs as soon as the iPT matures.
There is no guarantee that all the protocol PTs have been redeemed at that point.
As Redeemer sends to the user his pro rata shares of the underlying redeemed, if the underlying has not been redeemed, user will not get his underlying back.

While Illuminate can set the iPT maturity to be larger than the protocol PTs maturity, it has an interest to make this difference as small as possible, otherwise user tokens are locked without generating yield and without good reason.

## Impact
If a user redeem his iPTs before protocol PTs have been redeemed, he will burn all his iPTs and get 0 underlying.
When afterwards markets are redeemed and other users redeem their PTs, they will get underlying that belongs to that previous user, thereby making recovery of funds "impossible".

Note that it is not trivial for users or contracts to check whether all markets have been redeemed.
Therefore they may _accidently_ redeem prematurely and lose tokens.
As this kinda requires user error, I have rated this as Medium severity.
In my issue #8, I show how the `autoRedeem` mechanism, combined with this current issue, allows stealing of user funds.
I believe that these issues are separate, as even if you hold that this (imo legitimate) current issue is a design choice and risk you're aware off, the other issue combines it with `autoRedeem` to show how `autoRedeem` puts funds at risk.

## Code Snippet
When looking at the `redeem` that redeems iPTs for underlying, we [can see](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L403) it just checks that the iPT matured, and then sends to the user his pro rata shares of the underlying redeemed.
```solidity
    function redeem(address u, uint256 m) external unpaused(u, m) {
        IERC5095 token = IERC5095(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Illuminate)));
        if (block.timestamp < token.maturity()) {
            revert Exception(7, block.timestamp, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
        uint256 amount = token.balanceOf(msg.sender);
        uint256 redeemed = (amount * holdings[u][m]) / token.totalSupply();
        holdings[u][m] = holdings[u][m] - redeemed;
        token.authBurn(msg.sender, amount);
        Safe.transfer(IERC20(u), msg.sender, redeemed);
    }
```
Therefore if user/contract quickly tries to redeem his iPTs, and protocol redeems have not yet been completed, user would not get his correct share of the underlying.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only allow redemptions if all the markets have been redeemed.
You can leave an `emergencyRedeem` function that redeems regardless of this check.
You can also use the `unpaused` modifier to block redemptions before all underlying has been redeemed, but that is a needlessly centralized approach.

So how I would do it is:
- Implement the fix to not allow minting matured PTs - detailed in my issue #2. This will enforce that when a market is redeemed, all the PTs are indeed being redeemed.
- When redeeming a market (u/m/p combination), set a "redeemed" boolean (or bitmap) signifying it.
- Add a function that checks whether all the prinicipals (p) that are set for a certain market (u/m) have been redeemed. If yes, it sets a boolean that shows that the u/m market have been redeemed. This function will need to be called after all the individual markets have been redeemed.
- Change the Illuminate redeem function (and also `authRedeem` and `autoRedeem`) to only redeem if the u/m market redemption flag from previous step is true.
- These steps should guarantee that a user/smart-contract can't accidently burn their iPTs before markets have been redeemed.
- Consider adding an `emergencyRedeem` function that will redeem the iPTs regardless of whether u/m has been redeemed.
