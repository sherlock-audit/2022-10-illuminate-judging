# An Operator can min tokens for free

## Summary
If a `msg.sender` sets parameter `p` such that principal address == address(0), the `transferFrom` will succeed even though no tokens are transferred and mint Illuminate tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible for the principal address to equal address(0) if the wrong `p` parameter are used. The safe function uses assembly to make the transferFrom call. These calls always succeed when calling address(0). The function then mints Illuminate tokens in the `amount` msg.sender used. 

## Impact
This bug allows `msg.sender` to mint as many Illuminate tokens as he wants without sending any underlying.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if principal equals address(0) reverting if it does.
