# Slippage control should use `shares` rather than `assets`

## Summary

In `mint()`, the slippage control parameter is using the underlying `assets`, but it should use the PT token `shares`.

## Vulnerability Detail

When `sellUnderlying()`, the token received is the PT token, the units to calculate the slippage should be the shares of PT token, rather than the underlying.

## Impact

- wrong value of PT token could be minted in big slippage, and lead to user fund loss.
- the `mint()` could revert due to wrong slippage control.
