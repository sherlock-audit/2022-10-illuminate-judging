# The pool address in MarketPlace.sol cannot be updated.

## Summary

The trading pool address in MarketPlace.sol cannot be updated.

## Vulnerability Detail

First of all, the code does not upgradeable pattern. Meaning the code cannot be changed.

Secondly, currently, there is no way to update the trading pool address once a pool is set given an underlying address and a maturity.

```solidity
    /// @notice sets the address for a pool
    /// @param u address of an underlying asset
    /// @param m maturity (timestamp) of the market
    /// @param a address of the pool
    /// @return bool true if the pool set, false otherwise
    function setPool(
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        address a
    ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        // Verify that the pool has not already been set
        address pool = pools[u][m];

        // Revert if the pool already exists
        if (pool != address(0)) {
            revert Exception(10, 0, 0, pool, address(0));
        }

        // Set the pool
        pools[u][m] = a;

        emit SetPool(u, m, a);
        return true;
    }
```

note the section:

```solidity
  // Revert if the pool already exists
  if (pool != address(0)) {
      revert Exception(10, 0, 0, pool, address(0));
  }
```

**However, given the context that the protocol is trying to integrate 9 external protocols, and each of the protocols already iterate over a few versions, not to mention that the illuminate protocol has been interactive in development, the pool address can be deprecated and not functional.**

If this happens and the admin cannot update the pool address, the MarketPlace.sol is malfunctional.

## Impact

If the pool address is deprecated, the market place contract cannot be used to trade tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project remove the check to give the admin power to update the pool address.

```solidity
  // Revert if the pool already exists
  if (pool != address(0)) {
      revert Exception(10, 0, 0, pool, address(0));
  }
```
