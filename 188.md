# Incorrect returned amount check prevents users to lend

## Summary
User provided `minimum` slippage limit, minimum amount to PTs to buy is not respected and when such amount of tokens can be received from swap.

## Vulnerability Detail
function `yield()`
```solidity
src/Lender.sol
928:     function yield(
929:         address u,
930:         address y,
931:         uint256 a,
932:         address r,
933:         address p,
934:         uint256 m
935:     ) internal returns (uint256) {
```
which is used by
lend method for the Illuminate and Yield protocols and lend method signature for Swivel
does not respect users provided minimum accepted amount of tokens
becouse of this check 
```solidity
src/Lender.sol
951:         // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
952:         if (received <= m) {//@audit must be < not <=, can become a problem
953:             revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
954:         }
```

after `IYield(y).sellBase(r, returned);` we can get just right `minimum` amount accepted by user, but will revert anyway, 
## Impact
Users are not able to lend every time Yield Space Pool returns just `minimum` amount accepted by user, 
Users will lose time and money on attempts to lend

Manual Review

## Recommendation
change `<=` to `<`
```diff
src/Lender.sol
951:         // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
- 952:         if (received <= m) {
+ 952:         if (received < m) {
953:             revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
954:         }
```
