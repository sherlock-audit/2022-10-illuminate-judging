# Unsupported transfer-with-fee tokens

## Summary

Unsupported token with fee 

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens(e.g. `STA`, `PAXG`,in the future USDC,USDT), allow for charging a fee any time transfer() or transferFrom() is called.

For more detail, please read this.

[https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#fee-on-transfer](https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20%23fee-on-transfer))

Assume that `XYZ` token is a fee-on-transfer token with a 10% transfer fee.

Assume that the user deposits 100 XYZ tokens. 

The accounting system set the amount to 100 but the actual amount of XYZ tokens received by the vault will only be 90 XYZ tokens.

## Impact

Internal accounting issues occur due to not support for the fee-on-transfer or rebasing token

## Code Snippet

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L145-L169](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L145-L169)

```solidity
/// @param r The receiver of the underlying tokens being withdrawn
/// @param a The amount of underlying tokens withdrawn
function deposit(address r, uint256 a) external override returns (uint256) {
			/* ~~~ */
      Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), a);
			/* ~~~ */;
  }
```

## Recommendation

Ensure that to check previous balance/after balance equals to amount for any rebasing/inflation/deflation.

Create a whitelist in contracts to restrict token addresses.
