# Deposits don't work with fee-on transfer tokens

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
There are ERC20 tokens that may make certain customizations to their ERC20 contracts. One type of these tokens is deflationary tokens that charge a certain fee for every transfer() or transferFrom().

## Impact
The deposit() function will introduce unexpected balance inconsistencies when comparing internal asset records with external ERC20 token contracts.

## Code Snippet

       'Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(underlying), msg.sender, address(this), a);'

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One possible mitigation is to measure the asset change right before and after the asset-transferring routines
