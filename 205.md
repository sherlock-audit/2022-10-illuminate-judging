# `autoRedeem()` should check PT allowance

## Summary

In `autoRedeem()`, `uToken` allowance is checked instead of PT allowance. But according to the purpose of this function, it should be the PT allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail

`uToken` allowance would probably be 0, hence the `if (allowance < amount)` will fail. The `autoRedeem()` function will revert. 


## Impact

Users fund could be locked.

```
