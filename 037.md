# Lender.yield revert when amount recieved == minimum

## Summary
`Lender.yield` revert when amount recieved == minimum
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L928-L957
```solidity
    function yield(
        address u,
        address y,
        uint256 a,
        address r,
        address p,
        uint256 m
    ) internal returns (uint256) {
        // Get the starting balance (to verify receipt of tokens)
        uint256 starting = IERC20(p).balanceOf(r);


        // Get the amount of tokens received for swapping underlying
        uint128 returned = IYield(y).sellBasePreview(Cast.u128(a));


        // Send the remaining amount to the Yield pool
        Safe.transfer(IERC20(u), y, a);


        // Lend out the remaining tokens in the Yield pool
        IYield(y).sellBase(r, returned);


        // Get the ending balance of principal tokens (must be at least starting + returned)
        uint256 received = IERC20(p).balanceOf(r) - starting;


        // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
        if (received <= m) {
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }


        return received;
    }
```
The check for minimum allowed amount is incorrect.
```solidity
// Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
        if (received <= m) {
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
It should allow minimum amount.
## Impact
When minimum amount provided by user is received, function reverts.
## Code Snippet
Provided above.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to this

```solidity
// Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
        if (received < m) {
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
