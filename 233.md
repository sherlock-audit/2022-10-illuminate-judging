# Incorrect parameters

## Summary
Some functions and integrations receive the wrong parameters.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here, this does not work:
```solidity
      } else if (p == uint8(Principals.Notional)) {
            // Principal token must be approved for Notional's lend
            ILender(lender).approve(address(0), address(0), address(0), a);
```
because it basically translates to:
```solidity
  } else if (p == uint8(Principals.Notional)) {
   if (a != address(0)) {
        Safe.approve(IERC20(address(0)), a, type(uint256).max);
  }
```
It tries to approve a non-existing token. It should approve the underlying token and Notional's token contract.

Another issue is with Tempus here:
```solidity
        // Swap on the Tempus Router using the provided market and params
        ITempus(controller).depositAndFix(x, lent, true, r, d);

        // Calculate the amount of Tempus principal tokens received after the deposit
        uint256 received = IERC20(principal).balanceOf(address(this)) - start;

        // Verify that a minimum number of principal tokens were received
        if (received < r) {
            revert Exception(11, received, r, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
It passes ```r``` as a slippage parameter and later checks that ```received >= r```. However, in Tempus this parameter is not exactly the minimum amount to receive, it is the ratio which is calculated as follows:
```solidity
  /// @param minTYSRate Minimum exchange rate of TYS (denominated in TPS) to receive in exchange for TPS
    function depositAndFix(
        ITempusAMM tempusAMM,
        uint256 tokenAmount,
        bool isBackingToken,
        uint256 minTYSRate,
        uint256 deadline
    ) external payable nonReentrant {
...
  uint256 minReturn = swapAmount.mulfV(minTYSRate, targetPool.backingTokenONE());
```

## Impact

Inaccurate parameter values may lead to protocol misfunction down the road, e.g. insufficient approval or unpredicted slippage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Review all the integrations and function invocations, and make sure the appropriate parameters are passed.
