# Missing token approvals can result in DoS in `Marketplace.sol`

## Summary
The `setPrincipal` method approves `Notional` but not the other protocols

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setPrincipal()` method in `Marketplace.sol` calls the `Lender.sol` `approve` method for Notional, but it doesn't do the same for APWine or Element even though the `approve` method explicitly shows they need approvals too. This can result in a DoS if functionality is used where APWine or Element functionality that uses `safeTransferFrom` because it won't have the necessary approvals.

## Impact
The impact will be DoS on functionality using APWine and Element in `Marketplace.sol`

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the `setPrincipal()` method call `ILender(lender).approve()` for APWine & Element as well
