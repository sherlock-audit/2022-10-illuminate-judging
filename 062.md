# feenominator can only be set once in Redeemer.sol

## Summary

The function setFee() in Redeemer.sol can only be called once.

## Vulnerability Detail

Due to feeChange being deleted at the end of setFee() the function will become unusable after it has been called once. Unlike in Lender.sol (which has a scheduleFeeChange() function) there is no way to reset it and will be unable to pass the if statement on line 170.

## Impact

Admins will only be able to change feenominator once before the function setFee() will become unusable.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add scheduleFeeChange & blockFeeChange functions like in Lender.sol
