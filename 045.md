# Lending on Swivel: protocol fees not taken when remainder of underlying is swapped in YieldPool

## Summary
The `lend` function for Swivel allows swapping the remainder underlying on Yield.
But it does not take protocol fees on this amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
When executing orders on Swivel,
if the user has set `e==true` and there is remaining underlying,
the lending function will swap these funds using YieldPool.
But it does not take the protocol fees on that amount.

## Impact
Some protocol fees will be lost.
Users may even use this function to trade on the YieldPool without incurring protocol fees.
While I think it can be rightfully said that at that point they can just straight away trade on the YieldPool without incurring fees, that can also be said about the general Illuminate/Yield `lend` function, which swaps on the YieldPool and does extract fees.

## Code Snippet
In Swivel's [`lend` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L417),
if the user has set `e` to true,
the following block will be executed.
Note that no fees are extracted from the raw balance.
```solidity
                if (e) {
                    // Calculate the premium
                    uint256 premium = IERC20(u).balanceOf(address(this)) - starting;
                    // Swap the premium for Illuminate principal tokens
                    swivelLendPremium(u, m, y, premium, premiumSlippage);
                }
```
`swivelLendPremium` [being](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L960):
```solidity
        // Lend remaining funds to Illuminate's Yield Space Pool
        uint256 swapped = yield(u, y, p, address(this), IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, 0), slippageTolerance);
        // Mint the remaining tokens
        IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, swapped);
```
And `yield` [doesn't take](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L943) protocol fees either. So the fees are lost from the premium.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `if(e)` block of Swivel's `lend`, extract the protocol fee from `premium`.
