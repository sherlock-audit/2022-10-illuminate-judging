# Typo in maxWithdraw function could provide wrong return value

## Summary
Typo in the maxWithdraw function could provide the wrong return value.

## Vulnerability Detail
The maxWithdraw function of ERC5095.sol is used to calculate the amount that can be withdrawn by **an arbitrary address**. Right now, it provides the amount that can be withdrawn by **ERC5095 contract** if block.timestamp < maturity which is wrong.

## Impact
The return value which is the maximum amount of underlying tokens that the arbitrary address can withdraw could be wrong.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change `return previewWithdraw(_balanceOf[address(this)]);` to `return previewWithdraw(_balanceOf[o]);`
