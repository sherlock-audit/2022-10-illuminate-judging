# Lend or mint after maturity

## Summary
The protocol does not forbid lending or minting after the maturity leaving the possibility to profit from early users.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's take the mint function as an example:
```solidity
    function mint(
        uint8 p,
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        uint256 a
    ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (bool) {
        // Fetch the desired principal token
        address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p);

        // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);

        // Mint the tokens received from the user
        IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, a);

        emit Mint(p, u, m, a);

        return true;
    }
```
It is a simple function that accepts the principal token and mints the corresponding ERC5095 tokens in return. There are no restrictions on timing, the user can mint even after the maturity. Malicious actors can take this as an advantage to pump their bags on behalf of legitimate early users.

Scenario:
1) Legitimate users lend and mint their ERC5095 tokens before maturity.
2) When the maturity kicks in, lender tokens are redeemed and holdings are updated.
3) Legitimate users try to redeem their ERC5095 for the underlying tokens. The formula is ```(amount * holdings[u][m]) / token.totalSupply();```
4) A malicious actor sandwiches legitimate users, and mints the ERC5095 thus increasing the totalSupply and reducing other user shares. Then redeem principals again and burn their own shares for increased rewards.

Example with concrete values:
1) userA deposits ```100``` tokens, user B deposits ```200``` tokens. The total supply minted is ```300``` ERC5095 tokens.
2) After the maturity the redemption happens and now let's say ```holdings[u][m]``` is ```330``` (+30).
3) userA tries to redeem the underlying. The expected amount is: ```100 * 330 / 300 = 110```.
However, this action is frontrunned by userC (malicious) who mints yet another ```500``` tokens post-maturity. The total supply becomes ```800```. The real value userA now receives is: ```110 * 330 / 800 = 45.375```.
4) After that the malicious actor userC invokes the redemption again, and the ```holdings[u][m]``` is now ```330 - 45.375 + 550 = 834.625```.
5) userC redeems the underlying: ```500 * 834.625 / 700 ~= 596.16``` (expected was ```550```).
6) Now all the remaining users will also slightly benefit, e.g. in this case userB redeems what's left: ```200 * 238.46 / 200 = 238.46``` (expected was ```220```).

## Impact
The amount legitimate users receive will be devaluated, while malicious actor can increase their ROI without meaningfully contributing to the protocol and locking their tokens.
