# Reentrancy in lending allows overminting of iPT

## Summary

Insufficient reentrancy protection in `Lender` allows for minting principal tokens multiple times but paying only once.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some of the `Lender.lend` functions give the control flow to a contract whose adress can be passed arbitrarily as parameter. This enables reentrancy by passing in a malicious contract that reenters the `lend` function and causes more principal tokens to be minted than should be allowed.

The `lend` functions affected are those for Illuminate+Yield, Element, APWine, Tempus and Sense.

## Impact

More principal tokens are minted than should have been, leaving the iPT market undercollateralized, meaning the `Lender` contract wont have enough principal tokens from external projects to redeem all iPT.

## Code Snippet

This [gist](https://gist.github.com/Minh-Trng/6dbc866e2cf8a07a0506326b0553f5cc) shows an executable POC on how the exploit works for the Sense related `lend` function (mostly a copy of `Lender.t.sol`, but added `EvilSensePeriphery` and `testSenseLendExploit`). The exploit path works the same for all other vulnerable `lend` functions

Can be called with `forge test --fork-url https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/APIKEY  --fork-block-number 15189976 --use solc:0.8.16 --via-ir  --match testSenseLendExploit -vvv`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a reentrancy protection modifier such as OpenZeppelins `nonreentrant`. Also consider validating or whitelisting the passed contract addresses
