# Anyone is able to redeem underlying asset from ERC5095 contract pre-maturity

## Summary
The current redeem logic of ERC5095.redeem() allows a token owner to be able to redeem without burning token before maturity

## Vulnerability Detail
The ERC5095.redeem() is meant to allow a token (ERC5095) owner or approved caller to redeem the asset of the underlying token pre-maturity or on/after maturity.

However the pre-maturity logic allows for redemption of underlying asset by anybody, owner or approved caller without any token burining and thereby having all risks borne by the contract thereby which leads to theft and loss of funds. This is due to the direct selling of principal token and transfer to receiver without the `_burn` call.

Additionally, it is for owner and an approved owner to collaborate and steal funds from the contract with this pre-maturity logic by calling ERC20Permit.permit() to set allowance before each redeem call pre-maturity.

## Impact
Loss of funds

        // Pre-maturity
        if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
            uint128 assets = Cast.u128(previewRedeem(s));
            // If owner is the sender, sell PT without allowance check
            if (o == msg.sender) {
                uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(
                    underlying,
                    maturity,
                    Cast.u128(s),
                    assets - (assets / 100)
                );
                Safe.transfer(IERC20(underlying), r, returned);
                return returned;
                // Else, sell PT with allowance check
            } else {
                uint256 allowance = _allowance[o][msg.sender];
                if (allowance < s) {
                    revert Exception(20, allowance, s, address(0), address(0));
                }
                _allowance[o][msg.sender] = allowance - s;
                uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(
                    underlying,
                    maturity,
                    Cast.u128(s),
                    assets - (assets / 100)
                );
                Safe.transfer(IERC20(underlying), r, returned);
                return returned;
            }
            // Post-maturity
        }
```

1. Assume Alice does not own any token from the ERC5095 token contract.
2. Assume the underlying asset is WETH
3. Alice then calls ERC5095.redeem() function with the following arguments:
    s - 10000e18 - 10000 tokens (assuming decimals() is 18)
    r - Alice's address
    o - Alice's address
4. Assume amount returned after selling PT is 10000e18
5. Alice would receive 10000 WETH for free

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement the `_burn`  for pre-maturity logic to ensure the caller actually pays back to the contract while redeeming before maturity.
