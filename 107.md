# Converter is not approved to spend Redeemer's tokens for the case of Sense

## Summary
The **Converter** contract is not approved by the **Redeemer** contract at market creation or when calling `setPrincipal` in **Marketplace** contract, leading to impossibility to redeem for the case of the **Sense** principal.

## Vulnerability Detail
Function approve in **Redeemer** contract approves the **Converter** contract to spend the **Redeemer's** tokens of the contract passed as parameter:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L203-L207
This function, which can only be called by the marketplace, is called in function **createMarket** (lines 188 and 195):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L184-L196
and in function **setPrincipal** (lines 230 and 235):
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L226-L239
In both cases its used to make the redeemer approve the converter to spend the needed tokens for the cases of **Pendle** and **APWine**.
But if you look at the uses of the converter in the **Redeemer** contract, we see that the **Converter** contract is not only used in the cases of **Pendle** and **APWine**, but also in the case of **Sense**:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L375-L383
The **Converter** contract has no allowance to spend the **Redeemer**'s `compounding` tokens, and so, the call to `convert` will always fail for **Sense**.

## Impact
Impossibility to redeem **Sense** principal.

## Code Snippet
There is already a test in the test suite for sense redeem:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/fork/Redeemer.t.sol#L343-L381
But it does the trick in lines 370 to 372 to make the redeemer approve the converter via `vm.startPrank`. If you delete these three lines from the test, it obviously fails due to lack of allowance. The thing is that there is no way for the **Redeemer** to approve the **Converter** contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify `createMarket` and `setPrincipal` in **Marketplace** contract to call **Redeemer**'s approve function to approve **Sense**'s compounding token.
