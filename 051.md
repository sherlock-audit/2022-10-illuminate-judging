# Payable batch functions in Lender.sol and Marketplace.sol

## Summary

The function `batch` in both `Lender.sol` and `Marketplace.sol` is `payable`, so people can send it ether. However, there is no way to recover this ether so it is locked forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are three problems associated with this method:
1.  There is no method to withdraw ether in these contracts - any sent ether would be locked forever.
2.  There are no other `payable` functions, so the `msg.value` is not used anywhere.
3.  Even if there were `payable` functions, this would be even more dangerous. Delegating the call would preserve the `msg.value` accross all calls, so for one call of batch method, attacker could trick multiple methods into thinking that he sent them ether, even though it would be the same ether for all of them.

## Impact
Any ethers sent to the method are locked in the contract forever.

## Recommendation
Remove the `payable` keyword if it is not used. This will prevent people from mistakingly sending ether to the function.
