# Any external users can mint the Illuminate principal tokens

## Summary
- Any external users can `mint` the Illuminate principal tokens due to lack of validations.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Lack of validations on `mint()` function that allow any external users to be able to mint the Illuminate principal tokens (Illuminate's ERC5095 tokens).

## Impact
- There is no access control modifier on mint() function in the Lender.sol.
   - As a result, any external users can mint the Illuminate principal tokens (Illuminate's ERC5095 tokens).
     - This lead to an exploit that give large fixed-rate positions to malicious attackers without the attackers lend proper amount of tokens.

## Code Snippet
- This vulnerability is at the line of `mint()` function in the Lender.sol.
  - As we can see code snippet below, there is no validations such as access control modifiers on `mint()` function.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L270-L288
```solidity
    function mint(
        uint8 p,
        address u,
        uint256 m,
        uint256 a
    ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (bool) {
        // Fetch the desired principal token
        address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p);

        // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);

        // Mint the tokens received from the user
        IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, a);

        emit Mint(p, u, m, a);

        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used
- Manual Review (in Foundry)

## Recommendation
- Should use add `access control modifiers` in order to mitigate this vulnerability. 
   - For example, using access control module powered by `@openzeppelin/contracts` is better to manage access of each users.
      - Using `onlyRole()` modifier of @openzeppelin/contracts in order to check whether caller of mint() function is proper user or not.
