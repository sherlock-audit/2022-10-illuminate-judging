# Incorrect slippage control for Lender.yield

## Summary
Incorrect slippage control for Lender.yield
## Vulnerability Detail
Lender.yield requires `received > m`, since `m` is the minimum amount that the user can accept, it should be `received >= m`.
If the user provides an exact `m` , this will cause the execution of the yield function to fail even if it satisfies the user's request.
```solidity 
        if (received <= m) {
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
## Impact
If the user provides an exact `m` , this will cause the execution of the yield function to fail even if it satisfies the user's request.

## Recommendation
```diff
        // Verify receipt of PTs from Yield Space Pool
-        if (received <= m) {
+        if (received < m) {
            revert Exception(11, received, m, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
