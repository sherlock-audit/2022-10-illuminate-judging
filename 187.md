# Wrong time check on change fee in Redeemer

## Summary
Wrong time check makes it not possible to set fee after timelock, and makes it possible to set new fee immediately 
## Vulnerability Detail

Fee should be allowed to change after some constant period of time(3 days) like in
```solidity
src/Lender.sol
44:     uint256 public constant HOLD = 3 days;
```

`setFee()`  instead makes it so admin MUST set fee before the time set in `feeChange`
```solidity
src/Redeemer.sol
168:     function setFee(uint256 f) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
169:         uint256 feeTime = feeChange;
170:         if (feeTime == 0) {
171:             revert Exception(23, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
172:         } else if (feeTime < block.timestamp) {//@audit needs to be other way
```

## Impact
Can not set new fee after waiting time, but allows to change it immediately
Can be abused, or confuse admins and users.

## Recommendation
change the if condition
```diff
src/Redeemer.sol
- 172:         } else if (feeTime < block.timestamp) {
+ 172:         } else if (block.timestamp < feeTime) {

```
