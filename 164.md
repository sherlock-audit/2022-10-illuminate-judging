# Lender#lend for Sense has mismatched decimals

## Summary

The decimals of the Sense principal token don't match the decimals of the ERC5095 vault it mints shares to. This can be abused on the USDC market to mint a large number of shares to steal yield from all other users.

## Vulnerability Detail

        uint256 received;
        {
            // Get the starting balance of the principal token
            uint256 starting = token.balanceOf(address(this));

            // Swap those tokens for the principal tokens
            ISensePeriphery(x).swapUnderlyingForPTs(adapter, s, lent, r);

            // Calculate number of principal tokens received in the swap
            received = token.balanceOf(address(this)) - starting;

            // Verify that we received the principal tokens
            if (received < r) {
                revert Exception(11, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
            }
        }

        // Mint the Illuminate tokens based on the returned amount
        IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, received);

Sense principal tokens for [DIA](https://etherscan.io/token/0x9c5edebb6fe50c9447828a30a2414c061c74cd77) and [USDC](https://etherscan.io/token/0xA5240A4a27817135E2aB30c8f1996a2d460C9Db4) are 8 decimals to match the decimals of the underlying cTokens, cUSDC and cDAI. The decimals of the ERC5095 vault matches the underlying of the vault. This creates a disparity in decimals that aren't adjusted for in Lender#lend for Sense, which assumes that the vault and Sense principal tokens match in decimals. In the example of USDC the ERC5095 will be 6 decimals but the sense token will be 8 decimals. Each 1e6 USDC token will result in ~1e8 Sense tokens being received. Since the contract mints based on the difference in the number of sense tokens before and after the call, it will mint ~100x the number of vault shares than it should. Since the final yield is distributed pro-rata to the number of shares, the user who minted with sense will be entitled to much more yield than they should be and everyone else will get substantially less.

## Impact

User can mint large number of shares to steal funds from other users

## Recommendation

Query the decimals of the Sense principal and use that to adjust the decimals to match the decimals of the vault.
