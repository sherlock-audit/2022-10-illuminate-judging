# Some tokens (USDT) expect to always have zero allowances before approving a non-uint256.max amount

## Summary
The code approves non-zero and non-uint256.max amount for a token without first approving `0`. This will always revert if the token is `USDT`

## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens (e.g. USDT, KNC) do not allow approving an amount M > 0 when an existing amount N > 0 is already approved. This is to protect from an ERC20 attack vector described [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit#heading=h.b32yfk54vyg9)
In `convert` method in `Converter.sol` for example we have `Safe.approve(IERC20(u), pool, a);` which will always revert if the `pool` address still has allowance > 0 and `u` token is `USDT`.

## Impact
The impact is DoS for using a common token - `USDT`. Still, it is a special case, so Medium severity should be appropriate

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Before doing `approve`, always approve `0` amount first, for example for the code `Safe.approve(IERC20(token), pool, 0)`
