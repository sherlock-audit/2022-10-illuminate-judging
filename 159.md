# `transferFYTs()` can bypass `withdraw()`

## Summary
`transferFYTs()` can bypass `withdraw()`
## Vulnerability Detail

`withdraw()` allows admin to withdraw all assets in the contract. Initially, `transferFYTs()` is designed to only allow `redeemer` to retrieve FYT from the contract, but the function does not verify the address passed in `f`. Cause redeemer to transfer any amount of any asset in the contract. It is equivalent to `withdraw()` operation on any token of lender contract by redeemer

```solidity
    function transferFYTs(address f, uint256 a)
        external
        authorized(IMarketPlace(marketPlace).redeemer())
    {
        Safe.transfer(IERC20(f), IMarketPlace(marketPlace).redeemer(), a); // @audit 
    }
```
