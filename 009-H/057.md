# Redeeming Illuminate principal tokens before all principal tokens have been redeemed can cause the user to suffer losses

## Summary
Redeeming Illuminate principal tokens before all principal tokens have been redeemed can cause the user to suffer losses
## Vulnerability Detail
In the Redeemer contract, each redemption of principal tokens increases holdings[u][m], after which when the user redeems Illuminate principal tokens, the user gets the underlying tokens as `(amount * holdings[u][m]) / pt. totalSupply()`.
However, if the user redeems Illuminate principal tokens before all principal tokens have been redeemed, holdings[u][m] will be smaller, thus reducing the number of underlying tokens the user gets.
More seriously, since anyone can call the autoRedeem function to redeem Illuminate principal tokens for other users, malicious users can frontrun the redemption of principal tokens to make those users receive 0 underlying tokens.
And as pt.totalSupply() decreases, users who have not yet redeemed their lluminate principal tokens will receive more underlying tokens

## Impact
Users who use the auto-redeem feature may receive 0 underlying tokens
