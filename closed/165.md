# For at least the first 3 days after launch the users will lose 99.999% of their value locked to fees

## Summary
The fee math is incorrect in all `lend` methods in `Lender.sol` and results in almost all of the value input from users going to fees.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently, in all `lend` methods of `Lender.sol` (which will be the main entrypoints for users) the fee amount is calculated by the formula `fee = amountLent / feenominator` and then calculation for the actual value used from the user is like `uint256 lent = amountLent - amountLent / feenominator;`

The starting value of `feenominator` in the constructor is `feenominator = 1000;`. This means that if an ERC20 token with 18 decimals (the usual) was used as the underlying asset to lend, then the math will be like:
amountLent = 1e18;
fee = amountLent / feenominator => fee = 1e15;
amountLent -= fee => amountLent = 1000 

This means that the user will lose 99.999% of his value lent to fees. This will be the case until the `feenominator` value is updated to a bigger value, but with the current implementation this takes at least 3 days.

## Impact
The impact is loss of almost all of the value users input in the protocol and they can't get it back in a permissionless manner. Since this is certain to happen for the users in the first 3 days after the launch of the protocol, I think High severity is appropriate.

## Recommendation
Use a different formula for fees calculation or just set the `feenominator` value to a much bigger value
