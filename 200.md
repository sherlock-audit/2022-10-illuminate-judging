# Hardcoded slippage control

## Summary

In `ERC5095`, a hardcoded slippage control of 99% is used. However, the underlying yield tokens price may go down.
If severe market condition like Luna/UST happen again, users' funds may get locked.


## Vulnerability Detail

With hardcoded slippage control, in market collapse, there is nothing to do but watch the numbers take a deep dive. 


## Impact

Users fund get lock, and lose value. Redeem/withdraw functions won't work due to the strict slippage control.

Due to the possibility of big fund loss and lock during emergency markets condition, it could be high severity issue.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- let users determine the maximum slippage they're willing to take.
- the protocol front-end should set the recommended value for them.
- have a slippage control parameters set by the operator.
