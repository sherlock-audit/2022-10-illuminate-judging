# Wrong Illuminate PT allowance checks lead to loss of principal

## Summary

Wrong Illuminate PT allowance checks lead to loss of principal

## Vulnerability Detail

The `ERC5095.withdraw()` function, when called after maturity by a user with an allowance, incorrectly uses the amount of underlying rather than the number of shares the underlying is worth, when adjusting the allowance.


## Impact

_Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield_

If each underlying is worth less than a share (e.g. if there were losses due to Lido slashing, or the external PT's protocol is paused), then a user will be allowed to take out more shares than they have been given allowance for. If the user granting the approval had minted the Illuminate PT by providing a external PT, in order to become an LP in a pool, the loss of shares is a principal loss.


## Code Snippet

The amount of _underlying_ is being subtracted from the allowance, rather than the number of _shares required to retrieve that amount of underlying_:
```solidity
// File: src/tokens/ERC5095.sol : ERC5095.withdraw()   #1

262                    uint256 allowance = _allowance[o][msg.sender];
263 @>                 if (allowance < a) {
264                        revert Exception(20, allowance, a, address(0), address(0));
265                    }
266 @>                 _allowance[o][msg.sender] = allowance - a;
267                    return
268                        IRedeemer(redeemer).authRedeem(
269                            underlying,
270                            maturity,
271                            o,
272                            r,
273                            a
274:                       );

Redemptions of Illuminate PTs for underlyings is based on shares of each Illuminate PT's `totalSupply()` of the _available_ underlying, not the expect underlying total, and there is no way for an admin to pause this withdrawal since the `authRedeem()` function does not use the `unpaused` modifier:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate how many shares the the amount of underlying is worth (e.g. call `previewWithdraw()`) and use that amount when adjusting the allowance
