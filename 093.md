# redeem() maybe lost underlying asset

## Summary
before redeem all  'Swivel, Yield, Element, Pendle, APWine, Tempus and Notional  and Sense' 8  protocols to the underlying asset
if the user call redeem() to burns Illuminate principal tokens(ERC5095) to get the underlying asset
user will be lost the underlying asset.

## Vulnerability Detail
Normal steps：
1.market mature
2. someone calls redeem(p,u,m) to get the underlying asset,  holdings[u][m] +="redeem underlying asset"
3. user call redeem() burn ERC5095 shares to get "underlying asset" ,  holdings[u][m] -= (shares * holdings[u][m]) / ERC5095.totalSupply()

but step 2 Is called separately and requires multiple times.
if  8  protocols don't all Call complete， the total holdings[u][m] Will be smaller
Before step 2 all finished. if the user call redeems (), the same shares will get fewer assert
so Before exchanging shares, it is necessary to have a one-state judgment that has been completed to holdings[u][m].

## Impact
user redeem() may be lost underlying asset

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1.Add state that represent each protocols ' underlying has been successfully exchanged.
complete[u][m]=true
2.user call redeem() check all complete[u][m],if any one protocols don't completed will revert
