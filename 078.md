# When lending in Swivel, if last amount is less than the fees the execution reverts

## Summary
Swivel's lend function in Lender.sol will revert if last element in the array of amounts passed as parameter is less than the fees to collect.

## Vulnerability Detail
This line in Lender contract
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L401
Tries to take the fee from the last element of the amounts array (a), instead of subtracting the corresponding fee from each element of the array.
## Impact
In case the last element of the array is small enough, the call to lend would revert (also without giving enough detail to the user about what went wrong).
For instance if 
* feenominator is 100
* Amounts array is [50_000, 40_000, 200_000,10_000,2_000]

The sum of amounts would be 302,000 and so the fee would be 3,020. As this fee is greater than the last element of the amounts array (2_000) the call would fail.
## Code Snippet
I added a new test in [Lender.t.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/unit/Lender.t.sol) based on `testSwivelLend()`.
```solidity
function testIssueLastOrderAmountSwivelLend() public {
	// create the order/component/amounts
	Swivel.Order memory ORDER_1 = Swivel.Order(
		bytes32('asjfdk'),
		1,
		address(yt),
		underlying,
		false,
		false,
		10,
		20,
		30,
		40
	);
	orders.push(ORDER_1);
	Swivel.Order memory ORDER_2 = Swivel.Order(
		bytes32('qwerty'),
		1,
		address(yt),
		underlying,
		true,
		true,
		101,
		202,
		303,
		404
	);
	orders.push(ORDER_2);

	Swivel.Components memory COMPONENT_1 = Swivel.Components(
		1,
		bytes32('hello'),
		bytes32('world')
	);
	components.push(COMPONENT_1);
	Swivel.Components memory COMPONENT_2 = Swivel.Components(
		1,
		bytes32('fixed'),
		bytes32('rates')
	);
	components.push(COMPONENT_2);
	amounts.push(50000);
	amounts.push(40);
	uint256 total = amounts[0] + amounts[1];
	uint256 fee = total / feenominator;

	require(orders.length == amounts.length);
	require(orders.length == components.length);

	// mock the calls
	mock_erc20.ERC20(underlying).transferFromReturns(true);
	ipt.mintReturns(true);
	mp.tokenReturns(address(zct));

	// execute the lend
	// fees here are (50,000 + 40) / feenominator  = 50,040 / 1000 = 50
	// as this value (50) is greater than the las amount (40), execution reverts
	vm.expectRevert(stdError.arithmeticError);
	l.lend(
		1,
		underlying,
		maturity,
		amounts,
		address(swy),
		orders,
		components,
		false,
		0
	);
}
```

## Recommendation
Instead of just returning the total amount lent
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L384
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L982-L998
Consider modifying `swivelAmount` so that it returns the total lent, the total fee (calculated as `a[i] / feenominator` for each amount) and the amounts array updated as `a[i] = a[i] - fee[i]` for all `i` in the array indexes.
