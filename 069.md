# Using the wrong token address in Safe Transfer

## Summary
Using the wrong token address in Safe Transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Safe Transfer calls in burn() and burnForUnderlying() consist of the wrong token addresses which are the pool (See Marketplace.sol#L549 and .Marketplace.sol#L588). The pool does inherit from another ERC20 token (See Pool.sol and ERC20.sol) which is not the underlying token.

## Impact
Every function calls to burn() and burnForUnderlying() could be reverted.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
These should be typos. Instead of `pool`, it should be `pool.base()`, which is the pool's underlying token. Change

`Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(address(pool)), msg.sender, address(pool), a);`  to
`Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(address(pool.base())), msg.sender, address(pool), a);`

for both Marketplace.sol#L549 and Marketplace.sol#L588
