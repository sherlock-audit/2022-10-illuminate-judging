# Marketplace.setPrincipal funtion approves allowance for Notional incorrectly

## Summary
Marketplace.setPrincipal funtion approves allowance for Notional incorrectly
## Vulnerability Detail
`Marketplace.setPrincipal` is used to provide principal token for the base token and maturity when it was not set yet. To set PT you also provide protocol that this token belongs to.

In case of Notional the allowance is set incorrectly.

```solidity
        } else if (p == uint8(Principals.Notional)) {
            // Principal token must be approved for Notional's lend
            ILender(lender).approve(address(0), address(0), address(0), a);
        }
```

It provides address(0) instead of base token here, so actually `Lender` does not create any allowance.


## Impact
No allowance was created for Notional protocol, operations with it will fail.

## Recommendation
Change to this.
```solidity
        } else if (p == uint8(Principals.Notional)) {
            // Principal token must be approved for Notional's lend
            ILender(lender).approve(u, address(0), address(0), a);
        }
```
