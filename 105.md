# The Pendle version of `lend()` uses the wrong function for swapping fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

The Pendle version of `lend()` uses the wrong function for swapping fee-on-transfer tokens


## Vulnerability Detail
The Pendle version of `lend()` is not able to handle fee-on-transfer tokens properly (USDT is a fee-on-transfer token which is [supported](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/test/fork/Contracts.sol#L61-L62)) and pulls out the contract's fee balance (I've filed this issue separately). Once that is fixed there still is the fact that the Pendle version uses the wrong Sushiswap function (the Pendle router is a Sushiswap router). The function uses `swapExactTokensForTokens()` when it should use [`swapExactTokensForTokensSupportingFeeOnTransferTokens()`](https://github.com/sushiswap/sushiswap/blob/99c16c262f70a1ea8b6583c08c51f176eeb8f521/protocols/sushiswap/contracts/UniswapV2Router02.sol#L340-L346) instead.


## Impact
_Smart contract unable to operate due to lack of token funds_

Users will be unable to use the Pendle version of `lend()` when the underlying is a fee-on-transfer token with the fee turned on (USDT currently has the fee turned off, but they can turn it on at any moment).

## Code Snippet

The pulling in of the amount by `IPendle` will either take part of the Illuminate protocol fees, or will revert if there is not enough underlying after the fee is applied for the Sushiswap transfer (depending on which fee-on-transfer fix is applied for the other issue I filed):

558            emit Lend(p, u, m, returned, a, msg.sender);
559            return returned;
