# Deprecation of `base` function

## Summary

Use of deprecated function will cause incompatibility and indefinite reverts of essential marketplace functions for future pools.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to [Yieldspace code documentation](https://github.com/yieldprotocol/yieldspace-tv/blob/8685abc2f57c2f3130165404a77620a3220fb182/src/Pool/Pool.sol#L1508-L1514) the function `base` to retrieve the base token of a pool has already been deprecated and is prone to be removed at anytime.

It is still used in the following market place functions: `buyPrincipalToken`, `sellUnderlying`, `mint` and `mintWithUnderlying`

## Impact

All the functions outlined in [#Vulnerability Detail](#vulnerability-detail) will stop working if used in conjunction with a pool whose `base` function has been removed.

## Code Snippet

None

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the function `baseToken` instead which returns an `IERC20Like` that also conforms to `IERC20`, so there will be no compatibility issues.
