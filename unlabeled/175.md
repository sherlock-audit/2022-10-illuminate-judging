# `Marketplace.sol` is checking the incorrect variable for slippage

## Summary
The functionalities for buying and selling underlying and principal tokens check the incorrect value for slippage

## Vulnerability Detail
The four methods in `Marketplace.sol` for buying/selling underlying/principal tokens all do the same thing for checking slippage tolerance (example from `sellPrincipalToken`): 
```jsx
uint256 expected = pool.sellFYTokenPreview(a);

        if (expected < s) {
            revert Exception(16, expected, s, address(0), address(0));
        }

        // Transfer the principal tokens to the pool
        Safe.transferFrom(
            IERC20(address(pool.fyToken())),
            msg.sender,
            address(pool),
            a
        );

        // Execute the swap
        uint128 received = pool.sellFYToken(msg.sender, uint128(expected));
```
Here the slippage is checked against `expected` instead of against `received`. This way if the preview function of the pool is unreliable (usually preview functions are unreliable and only advised to be used off-chain) the user can actually receive less tokens than what he set as `minTokensIn`.
## Impact
The impact is potentially bigger loss for users than what they set they are fine with, hence medium severity

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the checks in the four mentioned methods to compare `s` (slippage tolerance argument) with `received` variable, not `expected`
