# Cant set principal for Notional

## Summary

Incorrect usage of `Lender.approve` in `MarketPlace.setPrincipal` causes the latter function to be bricked for setting a Notional principle token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `MarketPlace.setPrincipal` function calls `Lender.approve` like this in the case the principal is meant to be from Notional:

```js
else if (p == uint8(Principals.Notional)) {
    ILender(lender).approve(address(0), address(0), address(0), a);
```

In the corresponding `Lender.approve` function this happens:

```js
// u is the first param and address of the underlying token to be approved
IERC20 uToken = IERC20(u);
...
if (n != address(0)) {
    Safe.approve(uToken, n, max);
}
```

As the first parameter passed to `approve` is `address(0)`, this will attempt to perform a safe approve on the zero address which will revert, making setting the a principle token for notional impossible.

## Impact

Not being able to set a principal token after market creation might affect the [core purposes](https://docs.illuminate.finance/#defi-fixed) of the illuminate iPT by having one principal token less in the basket of integrated principal tokens (at least for a certain underlying and maturity date).

## Recommendation

Pass the underlying token address to the `approve` function as first parameter:

```js
ILender(lender).approve(u, address(0), address(0), a);
```
