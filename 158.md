# delegatecall() modify Marketplace.sol State variables

## Summary
delegatecall() modify Marketplace.sol State variables
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a `batch()` function in `Marketplace.sol`, and users can pass in bytes to execute in the context of the `marketplace.sol`. Because it uses `delegatecall()` to call.

`delegatecall`s have to be used with caution because the contract being called is using the caller's contract storage, i.e. the callee contract can alter the caller's contract state (for more info, seeÂ [Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html?highlight=delegatecall#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries)).

Then the attacker can construct the payload. Modify the state variables of the marketplace. such as `admin` address

        for (uint256 i; i < c.length; i++) {
            (bool success, bytes memory result) = address(this).delegatecall(
                c[i]
            );
            if (!success) revert(RevertMsgExtractor.getRevertMsg(result));
            results[i] = result;
        }
    }
