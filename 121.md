# AAVE withdrawal function signature miss match from both AAVE V2 and AAVE V3 in Converter.sol

## Summary

AAVE withdrawal function signature miss match from both AAVE V2 and AAVE V3 in Converter.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In converter conract, the first step is to try to withdraw liqudity from AAVE.

```solidity
Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(c), msg.sender, address(this), a);

// get Aave pool
try IAaveAToken(c).POOL() returns (address pool) {
    // Allow the pool to spend the funds
    Safe.approve(IERC20(u), pool, a);
    // withdraw from Aave
    IAaveLendingPool(pool).withdraw(u, a, msg.sender);
} 
```

However, the code may not work because IAaveLendingPool interface does not match either AAVE V2 withdraw or AAVE V3 withdraw.

The IAaveLendingPool provide the interface:

```solidity
interface IAaveLendingPool {
  function withdraw(
      address,
      uint256,
      address
  ) external;
```

In AAVE V2 Pool withdraw function, the implementation is:

https://github.com/aave/protocol-v2/blob/0829f97c5463f22087cecbcb26e8ebe558592c16/contracts/protocol/lendingpool/LendingPool.sol#L142

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) external override whenNotPaused returns (uint256) {
```

In AAVE V3 Pool withdraw function, the implementation is

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L197

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) public virtual override returns (uint256) {
```

clearly we can see the returns (uint256) is missing IAaveAToken.

## Impact

The withdraw may simply revert because of the function signature mismatch.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend change from

```solidity
  function withdraw(
      address,
      uint256,
      address
  ) external;
```

to

```solidity
  function withdraw(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address to
  ) external returns (uint256) {
```

and handle the return value properly in Converter.sol
