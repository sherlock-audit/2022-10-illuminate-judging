# `setPrincipal()` does not ensure that the right maturity has been provided

## Summary

`setPrincipal()` does not ensure that the right maturity has been provided


## Vulnerability Detail

The normal way to create a market allows for principals to be set after the market has been created, via `setPrincipal()`, but there are no checks that the current Illuminate PT's maturity is compatible with the new principal being set. In addition to the obvious maturity checks, there are edge cases that may be missed if the principal is added later: the six-hour sense sponsor [settlement period](https://github.com/sense-finance/sense-v1/blob/b71a728e7ce968220860d8bffcaad1c24830fdd0/pkg/core/src/Divider.sol#L31-L35) (referenced in one of the tests), the 48-hour Element [speedbump](https://github.com/element-fi/elf-contracts/blob/7d2293394eee1f32055c2f0bf66271133c7f411a/contracts/Tranche.sol#L31-L35) (not mentioned anywhere in the Illuminate code base), the one-block roll required for APWine FYT creation.

I'm assuming that the caller of `createMarket()` includes the appropriate buffer, but since it's not in the code, I don't know for sure and it may have the same issue (especially the Element speedbump case).


## Impact

_Permanent freezing of funds_

If the admin calls `setPrincipal()` with one of these PTs, but the maturity of the Illuminate PT comes before the extra post-settlement periods of the principals, users that provide these PTs for minting Illuminate PTs (e.g. to be used in the provision of liquidity), will lose their principal if they redeem (burn their Illuminate PTs) right at maturity, because there will be no underlying available, since the separate call by the admin to redeem the external PT for underlying will revert. In-the-know users that wait for the extra period before redeeming will recieve the principal of the users that were early, effectively stealing from them.


## Code Snippet

There are no maturity checks when setting the principal:
```solidity
// File: src/MarketPlace.sol : MarketPlace.setPrincipal()   #1

209        function setPrincipal(
210            uint8 p,
211            address u,
212            uint256 m,
213            address a
214        ) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
215            // Get the current principal token for the principal token being set
216            address market = markets[u][m][p];
217    
218            // Verify that it has not already been set
219            if (market != address(0)) {
220                revert Exception(9, 0, 0, market, address(0));
221            }
222    
223            // Set the principal token in the markets mapping
224 @>         markets[u][m][p] = a;
225    
226:           if (p == uint8(Principals.Pendle)) {
```

Redemptions of Illuminate PTs for underlyings is based on shares of each Illuminate PT's `totalSupply()` of the _available_ underlying, not the expect underlying total:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L422
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L464
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L517

If the admin notices the mistake after the fact, it's too late because once set, external PTs are immutable, and redemptions via `ERC5095.redeem()/withdraw()` are not pausable (no `unpaused` modifier on `redeem()/withdraw()` or on `authRedeem()`)


## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Modify `setPrincipal()` to ensure that the provided principal has a maturity + post-settlement buffer that comes at least two blocks before the Illuminate PT's maturity
