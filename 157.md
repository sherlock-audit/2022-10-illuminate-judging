# `Marketplace::burn()` Logic problem

## Summary
`Marketplace::burn()` Logic problem
## Vulnerability Detail
In `burn()` and `burnForUnderlying()` of the Marketplace, the comment says  `transfer the underlying tokens to the pool`. But the code is not the underlying token that is being sent

```solidity
Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(address(pool)), msg.sender, address(pool), a);
```

Here we should take `IERC20(pool.base())`
