# ERC5095 slippage checks can easily be manipulated with a flash loan, because they use `preview` on-chain

## Summary
The slippage checks in `ERC5095`'s functionalities can be manipulated easily because the code is doing `preview` on-chain, which can result in big value loss for users.

## Vulnerability Detail
All external methods in `ERC5095` - `deposit`, `mint`, `withdraw`, `redeem` have slippage checks implemented. For example in `deposit` it is done like this: `uint128 shares = Cast.u128(previewDeposit(a));` and then `shares - (shares / 100)` is used as the `minAmountIn`.
This is incorrect and can easily be bypassed. the `previewDeposit` (and all other `preview` functions) checks a `pool`'s preview function. Since this is done on-chain, a malicious bot (MEV) can use a flashloan to change the liquidity in the pool drastically and cause the `preview` functions to return much lower values than expected. Now the slippage tolerance will be much lower as well, and even though there is no slippage from the previewed amount, the user will actually experience huge slippage (depending on flash loan size). This can result in very big slippage for users (loss of value) even though they expected there are checks for this.

## Impact
Since it does not require the protocol to be in any specific state, and the code is just done incorrectly (previewing a swap on-chain and using this value) it can easily be done, resulting in a big loss for users of the protocol, so I think High severity is appropriate.

## Recommendation
Do not do the `preview` on-chain. Instead add a parameter for a slippage tolerance to the functionalities in `ERC5095`
