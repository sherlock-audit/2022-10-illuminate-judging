# Converter problems

## Summary
```Converter``` contract is not polished and may leak value.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are several problems with the ```Converter```. When trying to withdraw from Aave, it approves the underlying token, not the principal:
```solidity
  // Allow the pool to spend the funds
  Safe.approve(IERC20(u), pool, a);
  // withdraw from Aave
  IAaveLendingPool(pool).withdraw(u, a, msg.sender);
```
Also, if tokens are accidentally sent to this contract or unintentionally stuck (a reference to another issue regarding Compound integration), anyone can redeem them.

## Impact
The current version of Converter is not reliable to be used in prod.
