# ERC5095.sol#L98 : maxWithdraw should consider owner's balance to return before maturity. Not the contract's balance

## Summary

`maxWithdraw` is used to fetch the maximum withdrawable underlying asset value. 

This is a view function which will give the maximum witherable value.

## Vulnerability Detail

Instead of fetching of the caller's max withdrawable value, the function always return the contract's balance.

## Impact

The function returns wrong value.

I think, the function is not used anywhere int the contract. But, if it is used in the front end to fetch the max withdrawable value and use it further, then it will be a problem.

If anyone want to use the illuminate's ERC5095 feature and call `maxWithdraw` the this will be an issue. Lead to integration problem.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update the code as given in the if block.

    function maxWithdraw(address o) external view override returns (uint256) {
        if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
            -return previewWithdraw(_balanceOf[address(this)]);
            +return previewWithdraw(_balanceOf[address(o)]);
        }
        return _balanceOf[o];
    }
