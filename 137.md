# Lack of timelock for withdraw fee, lack of timelock for change admin and lack of two step admin transfer in Lender.sol and Redeemer.sol

## Summary

Lack of timelock for withdraw fee, change admin and lack of two step admin transfer in Lender.sol

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Lender.sol code, timelock is implemented when admin wants to schedule withdraw or schedule fee change.

For withdraw fee and change admin, the timelock is not implemented.

I think the change admin is at least, if not more important than changing fee and withdraw token from the contract.

Also, two step admin transfer is missing, meaning we are not sure if the changed admin is capable to calling the admin-related function.

## Impact

Lack of timelock for withdraw fee means that the admin can withdraw fee any time.

Lack of timelock for changing admin and two step transfer means the new admin may not have time to prepare for managing the admin-related function and in capable of manging the contract as a admin.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the project imiplmenet timelock for fee withdraw and admin change and add two step admin transfer (set a pending admin first and let the pending admin claim the ownership).
