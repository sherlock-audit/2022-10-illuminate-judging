# Bypass paused `redeem()`

## Summary

If the admin decides to pause redeem in `Redeemer.sol` when itâ€™s dangerous, malicious or unprofitable. The paused mode could be bypassed with `autoRedeem()` or PT token `withdraw()/redeem()` with `authRedeem()`.

Bypassing the admins decision can result in loss of funds for the project.


## Vulnerability Detail

In `autoRedeem()` and `authRedeem()`, the underlying can still be transferred to the user:
- the user just need to set the allowance to use the `autoRedeem()`
- call the PT token `withdraw()/redeem()`, which eventually call the `Redeemer` contract `authRedeem()`.


## Impact

Bypassing the admins decision might end up with loss of funds for the project.


## Code Snippet

There are no modifier `unpaused(u, m)` for `autoRedeem()` and `authRedeem()`, nor any checks for the unpaused status inside the functions.

PT token `withdraw()/redeem()` can be called even if paused.

## Recommendation

Add the modifier or paused status check in `autoRedeem()` and `authRedeem()`.
