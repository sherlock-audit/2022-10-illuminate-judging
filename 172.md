# Maturity expiration check is missing for `Sense` in `Redeemer.sol`

## Summary
The implementation in `Redeemer.sol` for the Sense protocol is missing maturity expiration check

## Vulnerability Detail
All other protocol integration's `redeem()` functionality check for maturity expiration like 
```jsx
if (maturity > block.timestamp) {
            revert Exception(7, maturity, 0, address(0), address(0));
        }
```
But this is missing for Sense and should be added

## Impact
If any code integrates with this and tries to do a redeem for Sense it will revert since maturity time has not passed.

## Recommendation
Add a maturity expiration check in the `redeem()` method for Sense protocol
