# AAVE withdraw guaranteed to revert in 0 withdraw amount in Converter.sol

## Summary

AAVE withdraw guaranteed to revert in 0 withdraw amount in Converter.sol 

## Vulnerability Detail

Converter is used to in Redeemer.sol

Redeem for Sense

```solidity
// Get the compounding token that is redeemed by Sense
address compounding = ISenseAdapter(a).target();

// Redeem the compounding token back to the underlying
IConverter(converter).convert(
    compounding,
    u,
    IERC20(compounding).balanceOf(address(this))
);
```

Redeem for Apwine

```solidity
// Convert the interest bearing token to underlying
IConverter(converter).convert(
    IAPWineFutureVault(futureVault).getIBTAddress(),
    u,
    IERC20(ibt).balanceOf(address(this))
);
```

Redeem for Pendle

```solidity
// Redeem the tokens from the Pendle contract
IPendle(pendleAddr).redeemAfterExpiry(forgeId, u, maturity);

// Get the compounding asset for this market
address compounding = IPendleToken(principal)
.underlyingYieldToken();

// Redeem the compounding to token to the underlying
IConverter(converter).convert(
compounding,
u,
IERC20(compounding).balanceOf(address(this))
```

The first attempts for converter to try is to withdraw fund from AAVE

```solidity
// get Aave pool
try IAaveAToken(c).POOL() returns (address pool) {
    // Allow the pool to spend the funds
    Safe.approve(IERC20(u), pool, a);
    // withdraw from Aave
    IAaveLendingPool(pool).withdraw(u, a, msg.sender);
}
```

note the parameter a is the amount of token we passed in.

There is a case when redeeming in AAVE is guaranteed to revert:

When the withdraw amount is 0.

For AAVE V3, this is where the transaction revert in 0 withdrawal amount

https://github.com/aave/aave-v3-core/blob/f3e037b3638e3b7c98f0c09c56c5efde54f7c5d2/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L87

```solidity
  function validateWithdraw(
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 userBalance
  ) internal pure {
    require(amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);
    require(amount <= userBalance, Errors.NOT_ENOUGH_AVAILABLE_USER_BALANCE);

    (bool isActive, , , , bool isPaused) = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getFlags();
    require(isActive, Errors.RESERVE_INACTIVE);
    require(!isPaused, Errors.RESERVE_PAUSED);
  }
```

note the line 

```solidity
require(amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

In AAVE V2, the revert line is

```solidity
require(amount != 0, Errors.VL_INVALID_AMOUNT);
```

## Impact

AAVE withdraw guaranteed to revert in 0 withdraw amount in Converter.sol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Clearly, 0 withdraw amount indicate something is wrong about the in the redeem function from Sense, Pendle and Apwine, the code should revert if the upper level before entry into the converter.
