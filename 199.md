# Element and APWine upgrade could break created market

## Summary

In `createMarket()`, Element vault and APWine router allowance are set. However if in the future these 2 contract were upgraded the address could change, while currently there were no methods to update the Element vault and APWine router info, the current `Marketplace` contract has to be redeployed to adapt the external contract upgrades.



## Vulnerability Detail

The `approve()` to set the allowance is only available in the `createMarket()` function. No future updates can be done according to current setup.


## Impact

The functions related to Element vault and APWine router transfer will not work if these 2 contracts upgrade and change address in the future. The current `Marketplace` contract has to be redeployed.
