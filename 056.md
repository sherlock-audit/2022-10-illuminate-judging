# Incorrect parameters when calling the initiate function, allowing the user to spend the fees in the contract

## Summary
Incorrect parameters when calling the initiate function, allowing the user to spend the fees in the contract
## Vulnerability Detail
In lend() for Swivel, the parameter when calling the initiate function is `a` , but in fact, in the initiateZcTokenFillingVaultInitiate function of the Swivel contract, `a + fee` tokens will be sent from the Lender contract to the Swivel contract, causes the fee to be actually paid by the Lender contract instead of the user.
```solidity
    function initiateZcTokenFillingVaultInitiate(
        Hash.Order calldata o,
        uint256 a,
        Sig.Components calldata c
    ) internal {
        bytes32 hash = validOrderHash(o, c);
        uint256 amount = a + filled[hash];

        if (amount > o.principal) {
            revert Exception(5, amount, o.principal, address(0), address(0));
        }

        filled[hash] = amount;

        IERC20 uToken = IERC20(o.underlying);

        uint256 premiumFilled = (a * o.premium) / o.principal;
        Safe.transferFrom(uToken, o.maker, msg.sender, premiumFilled);

        // transfer principal + fee in underlying to swivel (from sender)
        uint256 fee = premiumFilled / feenominators[0];
        Safe.transferFrom(uToken, msg.sender, address(this), (a + fee));
```
After that, the withdrawFee function fails because the balance in the contract is less than fees
```solidity
    function withdrawFee(address e) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
        // Get the token to be withdrawn
        IERC20 token = IERC20(e);

        // Get the balance to be transferred
        uint256 balance = fees[e];

        // Reset accumulated fees of the token to 0
        fees[e] = 0;

        // Transfer the accumulated fees to the admin
        Safe.transfer(token, admin, balance);

        return true;
    }
```
## Impact
Users can use the Lender contract balance to pay Swivel's fee, and the withdrawFee function will fail

## Recommendation
Consider subtracting Swivel's fee from `a` when calling the initiate function
