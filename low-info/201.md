# Rounding error in slippage control

## Summary

The slippage control in `ERC5095` is using the form of `x - x / 100`, which could be inaccurate due to rounding error.


## Vulnerability Detail

If the amount is 99, `99 - 99 / 100` will be 99, and could fail because it is too strict. A more robust way is to use the form `x * 99 / 100`. In the example, `99 * 99 / 100` will results in 98, as expected.


## Impact

The buy and sell functions could fail due to the slippage control not pass. Further the mint/deposit and redeem/withdraw functions could be impacted.
