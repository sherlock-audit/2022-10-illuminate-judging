# Function `convertToUnderlying(uint256 s)` does not follow EIP5095

## Summary
The `convertToUnderlying` function does not follow EIP5095 standard, when called before maturity
## Vulnerability Detail
according to https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5095
`convertToUnderlying`
> Before maturity, the amount of underlying returned is as if the PTs would be at maturity.

in illuminate docs  stateÐ² that
> upon maturity, may redeem the underlying at a 1:1 ratio

when `block.timestamp < maturity` we call `previewRedeem(s)`
```solidity
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
64:         if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
65:             return previewRedeem(s);
66:         }
```
which will lead to `IYield(pool).buyBasePreview(Cast.u128(a));`
Such implementation will result in not having 1:1

## Impact
Users, who view this as implementation of EIP5095 will get not expected results, which may lead to some value loss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Always return promised 1:1
```diff
src/tokens/ERC5095.sol
58:     function convertToUnderlying(uint256 s)
59:         external
60:         view
61:         override
62:         returns (uint256)
63:     {
- 64:         if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
- 65:             return previewRedeem(s);//@audit breaking EIP5095, should return s anyway
- 66:         }
67:         return s;
68:     }
```

If user wants to see what they can get before maturity, they should call `previewRedeem(uint256)`
