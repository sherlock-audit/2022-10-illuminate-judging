Refer the above links to get more about the redeem and withdraw standard of ERC5095.

As per the ERC5095 standard, `redeem` and `withdraw` functionalities should emit the `Redeem` event.

But, the illuminate's 5095 - withdraw and redeem do not  have the redeem event.


## Impact

Generally, events are used to inform the calling application about the current state of the contract, with the help of the logging facility of EVM.

Other application that integrate or use illuminate will suffer due this fact. They might assume that the event will happen and operations can be done which depends the event.

Other protocols that integrate with Illuminate's withdraw and redeem wrapper might wrongly assume that the functions emit the Redeem event. Thus, it might cause some integration problem in the future.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to follow the standard's MUST and implement them. This will be useful for both illuminate and who integrate the illuminate.
