# Unable to withdraw native coins like Ether from Marketplace.sol

## Summary
Unable to withdraw native coins like Ether from Marketplace.sol.

## Vulnerability Detail
The batch function (See Marketplace.sol#L617) is a payable function that allows users to send ether while calling any non-view function of Marketplace.sol.  However, there is no function in Marketplace.sol to allow the admin to withdraw Ether from the contract which can lead to Ether being stuck in the contract forever.

## Impact
Ether could be stuck forever in Marketplace.sol

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either **Remove the payable keyword** or allow the admin to **withdraw Ether from the contract** by adding the following code

```solidity
function withdraw() external authorized(admin) {
        payable(admin).transfer(address(this).balance);
}
```
