# Lending fee could be 0 if the lending amount is too small

## Summary
Lending fee could be 0 if the lending amount is too small.

## Vulnerability Detail
The lending fee is set to amount / feenominator (See all the code snippets mentioned below). If the amount is set to any value which is less than feenominator, the fee will be 0. 

## Impact
Assume that the lending fee cannot be 0, no lending fee is able to be charged.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
We can add the following code just before any line of all the code snippets mentioned above.

```solidity
  if (a < feenominator) {
        revert Exception(11, 0, 0, address(0), address(0)); // this 5 parameters can be any value
  }
```
