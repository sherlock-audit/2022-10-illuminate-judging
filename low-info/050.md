# `ERC5095.redeem/withdraw` do not work before token maturity

## Summary
When trying to redeem before maturity,
both of these functions call `marketplace.sellPrincipalToken`, which tries to pull the PT from the sender.
But `ERC5095` itself doesn't hold the PTs and doesn't pull them from the user.
Therefore the call will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
Detailed above.

## Impact
Impaired functionality.
Assets can still be sold straight via `Marketplace`.

## Code Snippet
For example we can see that [`redeem`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/tokens/ERC5095.sol#L284) calls `IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken` without pulling the PTs from the user:
```solidity
    function redeem(uint256 s, address r, address o) external override returns (uint256) {
        // Pre-maturity
        if (block.timestamp < maturity) {
            uint128 assets = Cast.u128(previewRedeem(s));
            // If owner is the sender, sell PT without allowance check
            if (o == msg.sender) {
                uint128 returned = IMarketPlace(marketplace).sellPrincipalToken(...)
```
And `sellPrincipalToken` [tries to pull](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L302) the PTs from `msg.sender`:
```solidity
        Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(address(pool.fyToken())), msg.sender, address(pool), a);
``` 
Since `msg.sender` is `ERC5095` at that point, and `ERC5095` didn't pull the tokens from the original sender, no tokens will be sent to the yield pool, and the redemption will fail.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Pull the tokens from the user in `ERC5095.redeem/withdraw`.
(The flow can also be changed to make the process a little more efficient.)
