# Low-severity findings

## Summary

There are a lot of findings that don't reach the severity of Medium, but there are some that are borderline, so I've included them here in case the judges disagree with Low as the severity


## Vulnerability Detail

The `EIP-5095` specification has [`convertToPrincipal()`](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/30f428a65d3b3673f08532e4622b64280b56178b/EIPS/eip-5095.md?plain=1#L127-L129), not `convertToShares()`. Users passing Illuminate PTs to other contracts may end up having those PTs stuck in the contract, because the contract may rely on `convertToPrincipal()` in order to give the user their funds back. There are also a bunch of other EIP-5095-spec-non-conformance issues which may have similar issues

Any FYTs in excess of the number of PTs are locked in the contract. This may happen if some user decides to [delegate](https://github.com/APWine/apwine-smart-contracts-public/blob/ec7468cd879bb245cb0ba2881e9df9141b8e80a3/protocol/contracts/protocol/futures/FutureVault.sol#L221-L223) their future FYTs to the Illuminate protocol, thinking that it'd save some gas

The maturity check should be a check for `>=` instead because, e.g. Tempus has [yield after maturity](https://docs.tempus.finance/products/master/developer-docs/tempuspool/fees) fees which users will unnecessarily be hit with. If the extra time is for APWine FYT rolls, that one can be special-cased.

Users batching their operations will be unable to pre-calculate all amounts, since it relies on slippage of separate pools, and any excess transferred to contracts is never passed back, which it should be
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L946


The pre-scheduling of a withdrawal does not include an amount or a deadline, so potentially an admin can schedule a deadline right when the contracts are deployed, then use it at any point in the future when they need to
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L782-L796


The timelock for the fee change does not include an amount or a deadline, so the users have no way of knowing whether the fee will cause them problems or not, or when it will go into effect
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L813-L820


There is no way to change the fee back to zero, because zero is rejected

Some of the PTs have their own rewards, and these are never claimed before the external PT is converted, so they'll be lost forever

`Safe.transfer/transferFrom()` don't ensure the token being transferred hasn't been `selfdestruct()`ed. If USDC has an unsuccessful upgrade and has to self-destruct, the Illuminate code will allow callers to transfer USDC that they don't own in exchange for Illuminate PTs. The fix would be to check the contract code length and revert if it's zero.
