# Users Sending Tokens To Contracts Stuck

## Summary

Occasionally users accidentally send tokens to a contract instead of interacting via publicly available functions. These contracts don't account for this scenario.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Redeemer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Redeemer.sol#L39)
[`Marketplace`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Marketplace.sol#L21)
[`Lender`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L42)
[`Converter`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Converter.sol#L15)

There is no functionality in any of these contracts that would allow the return of tokens sent to these contracts accidentally.

## Impact

- Users who accidentally send tokens to these contracts would not be able to retrieve them.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
contract Converter is IConverter {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Consider implementing functionality to these contracts that allows an administrator to return tokens accidentally sent.
