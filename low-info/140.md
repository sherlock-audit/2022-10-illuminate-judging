# principal value for element, pendle, APWine, Tempus, and Sense lending function is not validated.

## Summary

principal value for element, pendle, APWine, Tempus, and Sense lending function is not validated.

## Vulnerability Detail

Note in the lending function for illuminate and yield protocol validates the principal value.

```solidity
// Check that the principal is Illuminate or Yield
  if (
      p != uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Illuminate) &&
      p != uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Yield)
  ) {
      revert Exception(6, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
  }
``` 

same validation is implemented in Swivel.

```solidity
// Check that the principal is Swivel
    if (p != uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Swivel)) {
        revert Exception(
            6,
            p,
            uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Swivel),
            address(0),
            address(0)
        );
 }
```

However, such validation is missing for lending function in element, pendle, APWine, Tempus, and Sense

## Impact

Without such validation, the user can use a different principle token with different maturity to lend in wrong protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the lending function for element, pendle, APWine, Tempus, and Sense validate the principle value. For example:

```solidity
    if (p != uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Element)) {
        revert Exception(
            6,
            p,
            uint8(MarketPlace.Principals.Element),
            address(0),
            address(0)
        );
 }
```
