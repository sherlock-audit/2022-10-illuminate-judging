# No Upper Bound Feenominator Value

## Summary

There is no upper bound for the maximum value of the `feenominator`.

## Vulnerability Detail

[`Lender.setFee`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-10-illuminate/blob/main/src/Lender.sol#L228)

This function implements the ability for the admin to be able to set the `feenominator` variable used for calculating fees to be charged in lending. There's no maximum value validation.

## Impact

- In the event of a compromised/malicious admin this could be set to an extremely high value and users taking a loan will be overcharged on the fee they pay.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setFee(uint256 f) external authorized(admin) returns (bool) {
    uint256 feeTime = feeChange;
    if (feeTime == 0) {
        revert Exception(23, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
    } else if (block.timestamp < feeTime) {
        revert Exception(
            24,
            block.timestamp,
            feeTime,
            address(0),
            address(0)
        );
    } else if (f < MIN_FEENOMINATOR) {
        revert Exception(25, 0, 0, address(0), address(0));
    }
    feenominator = f;
    delete feeChange;
    emit SetFee(f);
    return true;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- Validate the new value is within an acceptable limit:

```solidity
    } else if (f < MIN_FEENOMINATOR || f > MAX_FEENOMINATOR ) {
```
