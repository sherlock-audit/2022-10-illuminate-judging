# scheduleWithdrawal is useless

## Summary
```scheduleWithdrawal``` is not effective because an admin can approve any address anyway.

## Vulnerability Detail
```scheduleWithdrawal``` is intended to give users some time to react and avoid a possible rug pull, but in reality, it does not make sense if we have this:
```solidity
    function approve(address[] calldata u, address[] calldata a)
        external
        authorized(admin)
        returns (bool)
    {
        for (uint256 i; i != u.length; ) {
            IERC20 uToken = IERC20(u[i]);
            if (address(0) != (address(uToken))) {
                Safe.approve(uToken, a[i], type(uint256).max);
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
An admin can just approve any address to withdraw any token making all the protections pointless.

## Impact
I know admin over privilege is considered out of scope for the current iteration of the protocol but I see this case as a special one because here the protocol was explicitly intended to protect against this attack but left a gap to overcome this restriction.
