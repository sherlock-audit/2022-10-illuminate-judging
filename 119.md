# Holders of worthless external PTs can stick other Illuminate PT holders with bad debts

## Summary

Holders of worthless external PTs can stick other Illuminate PT holders with bad debts


## Vulnerability Detail

Some of the supported external PTs can pause their activity. One such PT, Pendle, not only can pause activity, but can turn on [emergency mode](https://docs.pendle.finance/docs/information/others/pausing-mechanism#pausingmanager-contract) where the admin can transfer the underlying tokens to an [arbitrary contract](https://github.com/pendle-finance/pendle-core/blob/b34d265e4fe8e3a6f79bdec1ab88ab2fd49a882c/contracts/core/abstract/PendleForgeBase.sol#L98-L105) for safekeeping until they decide what to do with the funds. The Illuminate code does not handle such cases, and in fact, if the Pendle protocol is in emergency mode, will still allow users to convert their possibly worthless Pendle PTs to Illuminate ones.

While there is a mechanism for the Illuminate admin to pause a market, there's no guarantee that the Illuminate admin will notice the Pendle pause before other users, and even if they do, it's possible that users have automation set up to front-run such pauses for Pendle markets, so that they never are stuck with worthless tokens.


## Impact

_Direct theft of any user funds, whether at-rest or in-motion, other than unclaimed yield_

Other users that deposited principal in the form of external PTs (e.g. by minting Illuminate PTs in order to be pool liquidity providers) that have actual value, will have their shares of available underlying diluted by Pendle PTs that cannot be redeemed. Illuminate PTs are on a per-share basis rather than a one-for-one basis, so the less underlying there is at redemption time, the less underlying every Illuminate PT holder gets.


## Code Snippet

There are no checks that the protocol of the external PT is paused or has any value:
```solidity
// File: src/Lender.sol : Lender.mint()   #1

270        function mint(
271            uint8 p,
272            address u,
273            uint256 m,
274            uint256 a
275        ) external unpaused(u, m, p) returns (bool) {
276            // Fetch the desired principal token
277            address principal = IMarketPlace(marketPlace).token(u, m, p);
278    
279            // Transfer the users principal tokens to the lender contract
280            Safe.transferFrom(IERC20(principal), msg.sender, address(this), a);
281    
282            // Mint the tokens received from the user
283            IERC5095(principalToken(u, m)).authMint(msg.sender, a);
284    
285            emit Mint(p, u, m, a);
286    
287            return true;
288:       }
```

Redemptions of Illuminate PTs for underlyings is based on shares of each Illuminate PT's `totalSupply()` of the _available_ underlying, not the expect underlying total:

## Tool used

Manual Review


## Recommendation

Ensure that the protocol being used as principal is not paused before allowing minting
