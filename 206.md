# `Holdings` could be unfair for redeem amount calculation

## Summary

The underlying amount users can redeem is based on the redeem amount of external markets, but not the PT balance. This rule is not consistent and not fair to the users. Some users could lose fund, some could abuse this rule to steal fund.


## Vulnerability Detail

`holdings` will be updated when `redeem()` is called for the specific market. And later users can redeem for the underlying by burning their shares. However, this mechanism to calculate the underlying redeem amount based on the external market amount is not fair. Users underlying share should depend on the PT balance, other than the loan amount in some specific market and specific maturity.

Imagine the following: 
Some user has 10% of the PT total supply. Now 2 markets mature, Swivel with $1,000, and Sense with $200. 
When redeem for the underlying, if the user specify Swivel, the amount redeemed will be $100, but if use Sense as input, the user only get $20. Which is no consistent and not fair.


## Impact

- Users could lose deserved amount of fund.
- Some could get extra fund if some specific market and maturity have a huge amount of redeem.
- The above could be abused, some users could monitor such huge redeem, and call redeem the underlying immediately after the huge redeem. Effectively steal fund from other users.

## Recommendation

The redeem amount calculation should based on the PT balance, rather than the external markets amount.
